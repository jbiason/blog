Maybe you're in a project that needs to process some text. Maybe you're
tempted to say "Let's use Perl" 'cause you know that Perl is very strong in
processing text.

But that may still be not the right tool.

<!-- more -->

Although Perl is an amazing tool to process files, providing every single
switch and option you'll ever need, you're missing something: You're working
on a C shop. Everybody knows C, not Perl.

Sure, if it is a small, "on the corner" kind of project, it's fine to be in
Perl; if it is important for the company, it's better that if it is a C
project.

One of the reason your hero project may fail is because of this: You may even
prove that what you thought it was a better solution is actually a better
solution, but it can't be applied 'cause nobody else can maintain it.
