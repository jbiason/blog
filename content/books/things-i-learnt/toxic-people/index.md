You'll find people that, even if they don't small talk you, they will bad
mouth everything else -- even some other people -- openly.

Toxic people love drama. They love to put people down. They love to point
mistakes made by others -- but never by themselves. Some of them actually do
that to make themselves look better in the eyes of the upper management.

Not totally toxic, but I did work with people who would never answer an email
unless the manager was in the discussion. Another person would always claims
his team did everything they could, even putting himself at the disposal of
the manager to solve any issues, and that the problem was not related to their
work -- which we proved three times it was.

You need to stay away from those people. They will harm in ways you can figure
out immediately. Their attitude towards other (and maybe even yourself) will
drive you so down you'll waste more time wondering what you did wrong than
doing your job.
