A lot of times I heard "We should use the right tool for the job!" Most of
those times it was just a way to push an agenda.

When someone claims we should use the "right tool", the sentence mean there is
a right tool and a wrong tool to do something -- e.g., using a certain
language/framework instead of the current language/framework.

But sadly, none of those times it was really the "right tool". Most of the
time, the person saying we should use the "right tool" was trying to push
their own favourite language/framework, either because they disliked the
current language/framework or because they don't want to push the "hero
project".
