Someone that suffers from Hero Syndrome will claim that things won't work
unless they are carefully watching over everything.

I've seen this at least two times in my professional life. Usually, those
people are actually doing so much micromanaging that they are not other
realize when things are in trouble.

I've even seen someone doing a poor job on _their job_, so things would break
and then start calling people out that he had to fix it 'cause nobody would.

Don't do that.

I know you can get frustrated when you're the only one realizing things are
breaking apart, but you can add some
[monitoring](/books/things-i-learnt/monitoring) to your project, asking your
manager to show your solution -- you can even mention it on your group/daily
stand up meeting -- and pointing out to people how to realize when your
project broke. Suddenly, people will realize how to monitor theirs too.
