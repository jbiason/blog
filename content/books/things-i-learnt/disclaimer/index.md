There is one magical thing you need to know when reading this book: It's all
personal opinion

<!-- more -->

A lot of stuff I'm going to discuss throughout this book will come directly
from my personal experience in several projects -- system applications, web
backend, embedded, mobile, stream processing -- in several different languages
-- C, C++, Python, Java, Clojure, Rust. And, because it comes from personal
experience, everything reflects my own personal opinion on several subjects.

Obviously, you don't need to agree with every single point. But I hope at
least it will make you rethink a few subjects.

Also, sometimes I may mention some examples that people who know me -- either
worked with me, heard me complain about some project, inherit one of my
projects, _I_ inherit one of the _their_ projects -- may recognized and think
I'm attacking the author.

I am not.

We do mistakes. Sometimes we don't know the topic with are attacking,
sometimes we don't have full specs, sometimes we don't have the time to write
things properly in a crunchtime. And that's why some things don't look as
pretty as they should. Heck, if you think I'm attacking the original author of
some example, look back the stuff I wrote and you'll see things a lot worse.

But I need the example. I have this hope that showing people a few mistakes
can make things better. I want to show people how my opinion built over
some subject. And, again, I'm in no way attacking the original author of the
code. I may even call the code "stupid", but I'm not calling the author
_stupid_.

With that in mind...
