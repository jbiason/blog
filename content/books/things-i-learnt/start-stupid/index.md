One way to get away from the IDE is to "start stupid": Just get the compiler
and get an editor (ANY editor) with code highlight and do your thing: Code,
build it, run it.

<!-- more -->

Notice that say "stupid way", not "simple way".

Doing things in the stupid way is not the easiest way to start a project. How
could one beat the easy of clicking a button and having the whole structure of
a project done for you?

But starting it in the stupid way, in which you have to think your project
layout, how to build stuff, how to run tests, how to do _everything_ may give
you some insights on how things work, how the pieces mesh together and how to
cogs turn around. Even better: It make give you some insights on what
_doesn't_ work.

Honestly, you don't have to do this with all projects. You can still use your
favourite IDE and do things in the easy way. But you can also have that side
project on which you'll do everything in the stupid way, just to understand
what your IDE is doing.

And when you grasp that, you'll be able to use _any_ IDE.
