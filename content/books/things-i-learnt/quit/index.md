Instead of taking the blows and keep moving, maybe it would be better to your
own health to simply quit.

<!-- more -->

Unexpected circumstances caused a delay on your task and your boss lashed at
you.

You need to keep avoiding a guy that keeps bad mouthing some minority,
something that you don't agree.

Another guy keeps an aggressive posture around women, and you know that's not
something nice to do.

Yet a third one keeps complaining that, when he's not around, things don't
work.

I've to say it: You're in a toxic environment. Even if the pay is nice and the
project is interesting, it's not worth your health. You'd end up being a
constantly pissed off, annoyed person on your forties (_cough_).
