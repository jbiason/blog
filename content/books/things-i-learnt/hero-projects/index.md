An "hero project" is a project/spec change that you personally think will
solve a group of problems in your project. It could be a different
architecture, a new framework or even a new language.

<!-- more -->

Hero projects happen mostly when a single developer wants to prove something
without the support of the company or even the time they are in.

On those projects, developers will spend their free time to write a
proof-of-concept, just to prove a point.

And, sometimes, it just proves that they are were wrong.

(Although that last point sounds a bit sad, if you have to do an hero project,
you'll still learn something new and, maybe, even add a new bullet point to
your CV.)

Just to be clear: Sometimes an hero project will fail [because the answer is
obvious](/books/things-i-learnt/right-tool-obvious). Don't let that make you
feel down.
