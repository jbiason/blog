One way you can learn about yourself is to pay attention on how people react
to your actions.

I have a "angry man resting face", which means that, even when I'm in a null
mood, it looks like I'm angry.

I already had one meeting and which I started to ask something and noticed
that the other person move a bit back. That's when I realized that didn't
sound exactly how I meant. I had to add "I'm not saying what you're proposing
is wrong, I'm just confused."

Also, I got a manager once come up with "I thought you were _the_ serious
person... till you suddenly started singing in the middle of a meeting"[^1].

You need to keep an eye on this. How is people reacting to your reactions? Are
they opening themselves to you or are they closing?

[^1]: I have this "serious" problem that, depending on the word someone says,
  I recall some lyrics and suddenly start singing it.
