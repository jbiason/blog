If it took you more than one hour for you to figure out what went wrong, it is
a good idea to put it on list, 'cause these things have the tendency to appear
again.

I must admit that this is one thing that I should be doing, but I keep
forgetting. The worst part: It usually takes me about an hour to figure out
what went wrong, only to realize by the solution that I had the same problem
(with the same solution) before and it took me about one hour to figure out
what went wrong.

If I just had a list of stupid bugs that took me about 1 hour or more to
solve, I wouldn't be stuck for another hour figuring out what went wrong.
