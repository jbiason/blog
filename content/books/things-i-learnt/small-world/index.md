We have two expressions here: "The world turns around"; it means whatever you
do, sometime in the future, you'll face the consequences of it. Another
expression is "The world of _something_ is an egg"; because the world turns
around, if the world is an egg, you'll face the consequences sooner than you
think.

What do I meant with those two expressions?

Well, first thing, if you do a bad job, if you don't care about your
co-workers, if you're not a team player, if you keep bad mouthing someone...
You'll find someone that heard about the things you do and may damage your
reputation.

So be nice and a team player.

Just to be clear: Yes, I did my fair share of not being a team player and bad
mouthing people[^1] and I'm pretty sure there are companies around that would
never hire me 'cause someone inside heard that I bad mouth someone or didn't
do as a team player in some other place. I try to avoid doing it so as much as
I can but, hey, I'm just human.

[^1]: I still call actions of previous colleagues around even to this day. If
  I'm bad mouthing or just telling what happened is up to whoever is listening
  to me.
