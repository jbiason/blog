Richard Feymann, famous physicist, kept a notebook with the title "Things I
Don't Know".

<!-- more -->

I keep a similar "Task List" for myself. If some technology starts appearing
everywhere or something grabs my attention, but I don't have the time to
research it, I put it on this task list.

When I start my research, I keep some notes together, although [not on
paper](/books/things-i-learnt/paper-notes), so I can use as reference in the
future.
