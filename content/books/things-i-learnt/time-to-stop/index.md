Learn when you can't code anymore.

<!-- more -->

Learn when you can't process things anymore.

Don't push beyond that, it will just make things worse in the future.

I tried to keep coding once when I had a migraine (not strong, but not mild).
Next day, when I was better, I had to rewrite most of the stuff I did, 'cause
it was all shit.

Also, when you're not feeling fine, you won't be able to concentrate and your
productivity will plunge. It's a lot better to be a burden to society at your
own place than a burden to society at work.
