In case it wasn't clear by the URL, this is the blog of **Julio Biason**.

I'm a software developer/engineer/architect for about 30 years -- which
doesn't mean I know everything about software
development/engineering/architecture, but I do try.

You can contact me over `julio "dot" biason "at" pm "dot" me`, just convert
the things in quotes to their symbol and remove the spaces -- and all that
just because I want to make the life of spammers harder, and sorry about
making _your_ life harder, but still...

You can see my random thoughts on [Functional
Cafe](https://functional.cafe/@juliobiason).

I do have a Twitter account, but I'm not updating it as often as I do on
Functional Cafe.

I do not have a Facebook account -- not anymore.
