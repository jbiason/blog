Short version: New new blog engine and layout.

<!-- more -->

Long version: Just to change things a bit, I moved my blog from
[Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), for
absolutely no good reason. Actually, there is one good reason: Zola is a single
binary that I can carry around with my blog content, so I don't need to worry
about Python and VirtualEnv and download packages (although those things are a
breeze with Python).

But, for the sake of contantly changing and breaking stuff.... new engine!
