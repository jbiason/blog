# [New Features in Python 3.9 You Should Know About](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/21)

The great feature coming in Python 3.9 is the dictionary shortcut (`|`, as in
`new_dict = dict1 | dict2`), but there are few more incoming changes.

I talked about the future of Python on [PyCaxias](https://pycaxias.org/) this
year, and I pointed that Python grew a lot when it entered the web development
area and now that it is getting into the machine learning area, there will be
changes coming into the language to support this.

And if you ignore the dict operator, there is _a lot_ of things related to ML.

# [BashTop: Linux resource monitor](https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop)

When I first receive the link for this, I thought "I bet it looks like any
other bash script". But no, it has a well designed interface and loops
interesting as heck.

# [Avoid rewriting a legacy system from scratch, by strangling it](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/)

So you don't know how to replace your monolith with another monolith? Here is
one idea: Create the same API, put a gateway in front of the old system and
slowly reroute calls to the new service.

# [3 tribes of programming](https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/)

It's kinda funny seeing articles that try to pinpoint developers in certain
categories and end up just splitting everyone.

But this one kinda makes sense, if you're willing to put a random label on
yourself.

# [12 Signs Youâ€™re Working in a Feature Factory](https://cutle.fish/blog/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory)

Ah, the good old ways of just pushing buttons and pumping features, with no
regard to process or anything else.

If you're starting your dev career, at some point you'll work in one of those,
and recognizing you're in such situation may help your future.

# [Function overloading in Python](https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/function-overloading)

Ah, the joys of using decorators to add features to the language. In this
case, using decorators, you can add function overloading to Python, and even
if it is based on the number of arguments, one could extend this to use the
type hints for figuring out the function (with some work, I reckon).

# [git-trim: Automatically trims your branches whose tracking remote refs are merged or gone](https://github.com/foriequal0/git-trim)

Keeping your GIT branches clean is good for your health. Removing those stupid
"fix-this" and "fix-that" after they were merged, but not removing "develop"
and "master" can be hard work.

This small app helps keeping everything nice and tidy.
