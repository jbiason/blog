# [Libcsp](https://libcsp.com/)

Yes, C is pretty bad and such, but _holy cow_, this is pretty: a library for
async function calling in C on the communicating sequential processes (CSP)
model, which is the same used by Go.

And, personally, the code looks _prettier_ than Go.

# [Doing Domain Driven Design with Django](https://slides.com/mafinarkhan/ddddd#/)

Slides to a presentation about doing DDD with Django. Although it's a
presentation and, thus, this means is has to be short and not specific, but
it does a good job in explaining DDD and how does it relate (or not) to the
Django architecture.

# [How to blog with Emacs Org mode](https://opensource.com/article/20/3/blog-emacs)

In pushing the "everything plus the kitchen sink" of Emacs features, this post
explains how to write things in Org-Mode and publish it into HTML, making it
easier for someone to write posts in Org-Mode and then publish.

(Hey, this blog is written in Markdown and them published in HTML, so that's
not that weird!)

# [Optimizable Code](https://deplinenoise.wordpress.com/2013/12/28/optimizable-code/)

The great question about optimization. Sure, not do it prematurely, but this
boils down to memory alignment. This post gives some tips about it.

# [A practical guide to writing technical specs](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/06/a-practical-guide-to-writing-technical-specs/)

A roadmap on how to write a spec. While I don't agree with the front matter
part -- why the heck do you need to know who wrote it, when it was created and
when it was updated? -- it gives the general template for writing a spec.

# [How to Provide Test Fixtures for Django Models in Pytest](https://realpython.com/django-pytest-fixtures/)

While I'm not a huge fan of Pytest -- unittest is there already, even if it is
that panacea of methods -- this explains pretty well how to integrate Pytest
into Django, specially since it takes the road from the original unittest, the
one you learn when reading the Django documentation, and turns into Pytest.

# [Apple, Amazon, and Common Enemies](https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-amazon-and-common-enemies/)

This is a point about Apple doing what every monopoly does: If it can take
something from whoever needs you, you take. But don't think this is exclusive
to Apple: Google does that, Amazon does that, and so on.

# [Zoom Is Not the Problem â€“ Our Meeting-Centric Workflow Is](https://blog.nuclino.com/zoom-is-not-the-problem-our-meeting-centric-workflow-is)

This feels, initially, another of those "shut up and let me work" kind of
posts, but once again there is the call for "async communication" -- a.k.a.
"write a doc and send an email".

Personally, I saw both sides of this coin: Either we have a lot of emails
floating around, which made really hard to follow everything that was going
on, or we had too many personal talks and nothing was being saved for future
reference. I believe what you really need to have things written down, even if
they are preliminary and prone to change, but you also need a direct
discussion about some points from time to time, beyond the simple daily
"Yesterday, I did this, that and that, and that's it", which does not explain
the reason for doing this, that and that.
