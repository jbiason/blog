## [I want to own the database that my apps use](https://orndorffgrant.com/own-your-data-idea/)

While the idea is commendable, I think the proposed solutions have a number of
problems:

- Having an open standard only means having _multiple_ "open" standards. [XKCD
	explained this pretty well](https://xkcd.com/927/).
- Exporting data could, indeed, be in different formats, but using a database
	could also mean that each application would use their own schema (and
	remember the thing about the standards and everyone having their own?).
- As the author pointed, creating an API is costly. Why would some company
	implement the API when they can do nothing and save money?
- Worse: In a time when "data is the new oil", why would companies share their
	oil well?

I don't mean to diss the post, but there are a few things that need to be
fixed before we can dream of something like this -- for example, closing the
damn data-oil well.

## [Latency in Asynchronous Python](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2020/05/24/)

I'm not sure I follow the author description on how to solve the problem
presented.

Thing is, async (in any form) cannot be compared with threads, which seems the
initial idea on the description of the problem. Async is _cooperative
multitasking_, which means someone has to say "I'm done" so another task can
continue; by using a heartbeat task but doing I/O (`print`) and creating 200
async tasks, you're actually measuring how long the event loop wasn't allowed
to continue.

## [eBay port scans visitors' computers for remote access programs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ebay-port-scans-visitors-computers-for-remote-access-programs/)

In today's "Let's Abuse The Web To Find a New Way To Track People", some
people found out that the eBay website (yes, the website, not an app or
something like that) is using WebSockets (yes, websockets, not some fancy
technology, not some raw socket thingy) to do a port scan on the user's
computer.

There are two things that will happen now: People will start looking for those
things and stupid people will add that to their websites.

Maybe browsers could block websockets to one single address and, once it is
used, the site can't open a new one on a different address/port.

## [Rust macro rules in practice](https://dev.to/sassman/rust-macro-rules-in-practice-40ne)

Macros is a part of Rust I still have to explore. This post describes one of
the simples macro types Rust have (there are three).

## [How to organize your Rust tests](https://blog.logrocket.com/how-to-organize-your-rust-tests/)

On my last live (it was in Portuguese, sorry English speakers), we discussed
the fact that my toy project had no tests -- in my defence, that was kinda
intentional, as all I'm doing is exploring more of the language.

An just out of the blue this post appears, which describes a bunch -- maybe I
bit too much -- of testing strategies for Rust code.

## [Just: How I Organize Large Rust Programs](https://rodarmor.com/blog/tour-de-just)

And just related to the previous event (you know, the live discussing Rust
code), I was also reorganizing my code, and now have a few more ideas on what
to do in the future.

## [Beyond Remote](https://vimota.me/writing/beyond-remote)

A good collection of points now that large tech companies switched to remote
working (some as "remote first" now) about what may and what may not work
straight away when a company switches to remote working.

## [The Shapes of Code](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2020/01/14/the-shapes-of-code/)

This is one hell of an interesting post: Describing code by its shape --
basically, what you see in one of those "minimaps" -- instead of their
content. The curious parts is that it describes "what" the shape means and how
it can be improved in some refactoring.

## [The Public Domain Is the Rule, Copyright Is the Exception](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/public-domain-rule-copyright-exception)

I understand what the EFF is trying to say here but, at the same point, we
have to understand that copyleft -- the thing that powers every open source
project today -- _is_ based on copyright. The thing that prevents open source
being abused is the fact that is copyrighted by someone, and that someone will
tell exactly what others can do with the code. It's the copyright that
protects it from being snatched by someone else and being used to lock-in
users.

Maybe the idea of copyright is being abused in a lot of places, but it doesn't
mean it is (totally) broken.

One thing to keep in mind here: Public Domain means anyone can do anything
with it. It could mean anyone could pick an free software and turn it into a
locked-in version of it.

## [What Does *Free/Libre/Open* Mean?](https://wiki.snowdrift.coop/about/free-libre-open)

This is a quick and good explanation of the old discussion of the difference
between "free software" and "open source".
