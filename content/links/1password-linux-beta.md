1Password, the famous password management tool, published a blog about
releasing a beta version of their tool [for
Linux](https://blog.1password.com/1password-for-linux-beta-is-now-open/).

Now, we always welcome a tool for Linux, specially the ones with names already
know in the market, 'cause that gives the public a perception that Linux
exists and that larger companies give a fuck about it, and so on.

But what caught my eye is this line: "Its backend is written completely in
Rust". Not just because I'm a fan of Rust, but because

1. the application doesn't look like a native application; it looks like an
   Electron application;
2. this kind of action with Rust reminds of another technology that also wasn't
   well known, but caught engineers attention, and then, suddenly, it took off
   and now is widely used.

That technology was Linux. And the same thing seems to be happening to Rust.
And this gives me a lot of hope in the future.
