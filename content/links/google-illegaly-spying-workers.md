TheVerge posted some news about [Google Firing
Workers](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint)
based on information from a company they hired to spy their own workers.

I mean, that's nothing new: the "Do no evil" motto is long gone, and we see,
every day, Google threating their users like cattle for profit. But now we see
more and more news about Google trying to stop their own workers on getting a
proper working environment.

Sadly, this is not the only one: We knew something was wrong way long, when in
2018 a group of workers had to make a public walkout in protest to the way
Google were dealing with sexual misconduct and forced arbitration -- something
that made Andy Rubin, author of Android, being "fired" from the company. From
there, everything needs to find its way to the news, otherwise it just hid
under the hug.

The fact that Google is pushing to spying their own workers show how bad the
environment is there.

Before I go into a long rant about the continuous noticing of those events, I
need to make a request: STOP USING GOOGLE PRODUCTS. When you use, you are
basically telling them it's ok to continue doing it so.
