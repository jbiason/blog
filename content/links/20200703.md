## [Image decay as a service](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/image-decay-as-a-service)

Although it mentions "Image", this post is actually a very good (as Amos'
posts usually are) explaining async Rust and Tide from the very beginning.

## [Redesigning Github repository page](https://tonsky.me/blog/github-redesign/)

Github presented a new layout recently, but some things are not... quite in
place.

Here, Nikita explores the interface step by step, checking every element and
how to make them work.

## [Apple declined to implement 16 Web APIs in Safari due to privacy concerns](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-declined-to-implement-16-web-apis-in-safari-due-to-privacy-concerns/)

You have one chance to figure out who proposed most of those 16 APIs.

Also, not to just pick on anyone or defend Apple, but some of those are
completely absurd for a web thing -- unless you want the web to become a whole
operating system, something that would make a lot more sense in, I don't know,
a native application running on a real operating system, maybe?

## [Fira](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/)

Mozilla took the task of keeping Fira -- and Fira Code -- fonts. 

The only issue I found: No ligatures on the mono version. There is an issue
open since 2016 but the ligatures are not there (at least, the common ones,
like "==", "->" and "=>", that make those appear as a single character).

Sadly, for now, I'm sticking with
[Cascadia](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases).

## [The Runbooks Project](https://containersolutions.github.io/runbooks/)

I'm a huge fan of Runbooks. Why? Because, some day, you'll be on call and
things will go wrong and you'll have no idea what to do, but there it is, a
list of things that can go wrong and how to fix them.

And here are some generic runbooks to take care of common things when they go
wrong.

## [What is Zig's “Colorblind” Async/Await?](https://kristoff.it/blog/zig-colorblind-async-await/)

Async/await is in all rage these days, and Zig is a small language that takes
a lot of C, but tries to fix some of its issues.

And here is an introduction directly of async/await in Zig, so you can get a
good "feel" of the language.
