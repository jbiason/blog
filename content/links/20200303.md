Interesting links for 2020-03-03.

<!-- more -->

* [The situation with Go on
	OpenBSD](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoOpenBSDSituation):
	I'm not interested in Go itself, but I've read similar things about Rust
	on the *BSD. It's sad that such platform is a second class citizen for
	newer, compiled languages.
* [Facebook's Download-Your-Data Tool Is
	Incomplete](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/03/facebooks_downl.html):
	Ok, first of all, delete your Facebook account (even if they still create
	a "dark profile" of you). Second, with GDPR laws coming in full force
	(like the California Privacy Law and the Brazilian version of GDPR, LGPD),
	it's amazing to see that companies built on collecting everything about
	you _still_ fail to get in line.
* [On C and embedded
	platforms](https://blog.teserakt.io/2020/03/02/on-c-and-embedded-platforms/):
	Although focused on embedded devices (which the post itself claims is a
	lot larger and more limited than a Raspberry), it gives a long explanation
	about the way C source is turned into an executable (and I may need some
	points of this for a presentation called "The Secret Life of the Linker").
* [42 Unique Productivity Tips: How to be more Productive with Less
	Effort](https://karenapp.io/articles/how-to-be-more-productive-less-effort/):
	Weirdly enough, I think I do half of those already, but I still don't
	think I'm as productive as I should. Also, some points seem incomplete,
	like the "Biological Prime Time", which lacks information on _how_ you
	figure out your BPT. On the other hand, "Create a Todonâ€™t List" is
	something I never thought before!
* [Windows 93](https://www.windows93.net/): Have some time to play with
	something stupid? Someone built a "remixed" version of Windows 95 with
	HTML+CSS+JS.
* [fork() can fail: this is
	important](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2014/08/19/fork/): Yes, `fork()`
	can fail and you should check for failures; also yes, `malloc()` can fail
	and you should check for failures. And this reminds me of Rust `Result`
	(which you can also use in Haskell) and the fact that the compiler does
	not let you get away from ignoring the errors. More languages should be
	built like this.
* [Production Oriented
	Development](https://paulosman.me/2019/12/30/production-oriented-development.html):
	[^1] Ok, it's DevOps, but let's talk about this _again_ for the people in
	the back. The only point that I need to point that one should be careful
	about is "Buy Almost Always Beats Build": Sure, buying a done product is
	better than a will-be product, but it may also force something akin to the
	use of Design Patterns: changing the (real) problem to make it fit the
	pattern or, in this case, changing the real problem to fit the tool.
* [Vim plugins that I use](https://catonmat.net/vim-plugins): A list of VIM
	plugins. I have my fair share of plugins installed, but HOLY COW, that's
	too much even for me.

[^1]: I think I shared this on Mastodon before, but I realized there is one
  small point that needs some clarification.
