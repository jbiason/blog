# [Always Be Journaling](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/12/14/always-be-journaling/)

Today in "Things I Know I Should Be Doing But I Don't": Journaling.

I've seen this "pattern" a few times: Take notes of everything you're doing;
take notes of problems you solve; keep notes of discussions you had. Those are
all important and can save your butt in the future.

# [Programming is not a goal.](https://ralsina.me/weblog/posts/programming-is-not-a-goal.html)

I was kinda expecting the "Programming is not a goal, providing value for your
customers is", but this is way more direct than you can think. It's the clear
suggestion for those who are starting to focus on solving their own problems
instead of just coding.

Figuring out how to scrap a website is ok, but what will you do with the data.
Building a neural network may be used in your CV when you're looking for that
high-paying job, but you're going to train to fix _what_?

# [What is cache penetration, cache breakdown and cache avalanche?](https://www.pixelstech.net/article/1586522853-What-is-cache-penetration-cache-breakdown-and-cache-avalanche)

I suck at using the "proper" words for some contexts: I used a bunch of
patterns, but heck if I can remember (or even if I really know) their proper
names.

This is the same thing: Just some clarification on how to call some
problems/situations with caches.

# [GNOME has a ‘Secret’ Screen Recorder. Here’s How to Use it!](https://itsfoss.com/gnome-screen-recorder/)

This is a cool thing: You can record your desktop if you're using GNOME. The
recording will appear as a `webm` in your "Videos" folder.

# [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/)

This should not come as a surprise to anyone who was part any moderately large
project: things change.

Yes, agile is a way to solve this, but we need to teach developers to "let go"
of their code. We write code expecting it to live forever, and then the
requirements change and we hung up on those little grouped words and instead
of removing and starting with a fresh view, we try to twists and push things
around till it works, but is barely recognizable.

This part agile doesn't teach us.

# [Using Vim as a password manager](https://invert.svbtle.com/using-vim-as-a-password-manager)

A little stupid trick using VIM: VIM can encrypt files when saving them, so
you can pick a file, put your passwords, and save it in encrypted form.

# [Pay Up, Or We’ll Make Google Ban Your Ads](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/pay-up-or-well-make-google-ban-your-ads/)

Not only we have the problem with Google acting the way it wants with its
products -- and as much as we don't like it, we can't deny its in their own
right to do so -- now people have to worry about people tricking Google into
killing your... revenue.

And I think that's one of the basis of the whole problem with privacy and the
general use of Google products: revenue. Imagine how scared someone could be
if they decide to pay U$ 5000 just to not kill their revenue.

There has to be a better way.
