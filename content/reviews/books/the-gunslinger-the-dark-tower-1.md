[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43615.The_Gunslinger):
In the first book of this brilliant series, Stephen King introduces readers to
one of his most enigmatic heroes, Roland of Gilead, The Last Gunslinger. He is
a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into good and evil. In
his desolate world, which frighteningly mirrors our own, Roland pursues The
Man in Black, encounters an alluring woman named Alice, and begins a
friendship with the Kid from Earth called Jake. Both grippingly realistic and
eerily dreamlike, The Gunslinger leaves readers eagerly awaiting the next
chapter.

It pretty much felt like "the movie that started the series" from the 80s.

A lot of the stuff is basically the Gunslinger telling his story or thinking
about the past. Sure it gives a nice explanation about the current status of
the characters, but it also drains the amount of "current status".

Also, some descriptions felt hard to follow. Sure it's easy to explain how a
train station looks like and what's in it, but a cave... Good luck following
what's happening there.
