[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28166034-how-to-make-mistakes-in-python):
Even the best programmers make mistakes, and experienced programmer Mike
Pirnat has made his share during 15+ years with Python. Some have been simple
and silly; others were embarrassing and downright costly. In this Oâ€™Reilly
report, he dissects some of his most memorable blunders, peeling them back
layer-by-layer to reveal just what went wrong.

For anyone that works with Python for some time, most of the content of this
book is "Hahaha, yeah, I did that too. The good old bad times." And, surely
enough, you can't hold yourself nodding when the author mentions that you
shouldn't do that.

I felt it lacked a bit of "this is the right way of doing it", like Uncle Bob
did with _Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_, where he
picks a code and starts refactoring till it gets "correct". Most of the time,
it's a bunch of code (sometimes, invalid code, but that's minor) and then a
simple "don't do that".
