For a short story, with the content coming out of order -- on purpose: the
author points "I'll first tell you the middle, then the start, and
the end. Here is the middle" and then "Here is how this begins" -- there are
some pretty good points here. For example, the fact that we run so much worried
about being late, and having a time for everything, that the government makes a
department to make sure things work in precise time for maximal efficiency.

Out of that, it is a pretty crazy story. Good, making sense, but crazy,
nonetheless.Good, making sense, but crazy, nonetheless.Good, making sense, but
