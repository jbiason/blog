This is a book about passive detection. Or active detection. Or attacks. I really don't know, because the subject keeps jumping around so much you have no idea the point the author wants to make.

There are plenty explanations for stuff, but mostly is dumbed down to the point it doesn't even make sense. Besides that, you have explanations for attacks that sounds really scary/cool (depending on your point of view) but after you think a bit about it, it is really hard to execute and, with the necessary access to do so, you wouldn't really need this kind of stuff.

Also, there is plenty of "this author research" or "a research that yours truly did" that sounds more like "Hey, look how awesome I am" than "you should really worry about this thing".

About the edition, there are original articles in their original form, but they are presented in mono spaced font in a weird indentation that doesn't fit any layout you chose (landscape, two columns landscape, portrait). Also, there are chapter footnotes and book footnotes and both follow the same format, which means you will find a "[1]", followed by a "[100]", followed by a "[2]". And the author uses "Too," instead of "Also," which, for a non-native English speaking person like me, sounds strange as hell.
