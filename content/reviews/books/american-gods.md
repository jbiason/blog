**A very hard book to read **

When I was halfway through it, I though I'd give this book 4 stars; when I was
3/4 through it, I though about giving it only 3 stars; then, in the very end,
I decided to give 5 stars. 

Thing is, this is not an easy book to read. It's freaking hard, opening
several threads at once, which give the feel that you're reading things that
make absolutely nothing to the story. And then, in the very end, all threads
are neatly closed. If you manage to keep up to the continuous words that feel
worthless and read till the end, you'll get a nicely packaged story, worth
your time.
