**A very hard book to read **

When I was halfway through it, I though I'd give this book 4 stars; when I was 3/4 through it, I though about giving it only 3 stars; then, in the very end, I decided to give 5 stars. 

Thing is, this is not an easy book to read. It's freaking hard, opening several threads at once, which give the feel that you're reading things that make absolutely nothing to the story. And then, in the very end, all threads are neatly closed. If you manage to keep up to the continuous words that feel worthless and read till the end, you'll get a nicely packaged story, worth your time.
