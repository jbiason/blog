[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840278.Eon):
The 21st century was on the brink of nuclear confrontation when the 300
kilometer-long stone flashed out of nothingness and into Earth's orbit. NASA,
NATO, and the UN sent explorers to the asteroid's surface...and discovered
marvels and mysteries to drive researchers mad.

_Rendezvous with Rama_. It's all I could think while reading this book. I
mean, it's a very large, strange object, which humans from Earth get inside
and, while the story progresses, suddenly there are some kind of benevolent
aliens, but the real monsters are the humans, in the end. And, as Rendezvous,
there is a lot of over-describing stuff that is not actually important for the
plot.

Sure, there are some twists, like who the aliens really are (while later in
the Rama series you get *why* the aliens built the spaceship in the first
place) and while the over-descriptions of how the aliens (in this book) look
like, even if they are curious, show a lot of creativity from the author, they
still are over-descriptions that add absolutely nothing to the plot.

In the end, curious, but boring.
