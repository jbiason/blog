I must say, I was really surprised by this book. Not only it goes a great
length to explain things about Angular (the base for Ionic), but builds
<b>two</b> applications from start to end, connects to other services and also
explains how to publish your application.

But (and there is always a "but") I felt some things lacking. For example, the
author says that he prefers to use grunt instead of the default ionic tool,
but after that, he *only* uses the ionic tool; there are some things wrong
with the book (why I already submitted as an errata for it); there is very
little mention on how to deal with different rotations; and the gravest
problem of all, in my opinion: There are absolutely no tests. At all. Not even
a mention on how to test your Ionic app.

Other that those problems (which are really minor, related to the amount of
information), it is really a good book to start working with Ionic apps.
