[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28196387-the-little-book-of-html-css-coding-guidelines):
A proper plan can improve your code, including your HTML documents and CSS
style sheets. Jens Oliver Meiert explores the theory and practice of coding
guidelines and shows, using Google’s HTML and CSS standards as a particular
example, how consistency and care can make the code base you create today much
easier to deal with when you—or someone else—work on it later.

There isn't much to say about this book, because this book doesn't say much. 

Actually, you could say it says half of what it should, since half of the book
is not about the guidelines, but about how great guidelines are. Not that
useless, but a simply "they are good, Mkay?" would suffice. 

About the guidelines themselves, they are heavily based on Google guidelines,
mostly because those guidelines and this book have the same author. There is
no amazing things or suggestions, mostly of them are guidelines that everybody
follows and others are mostly harmless in the sense that they don't affect
reading, like double quotes instead of single quotes.

So, nothing really ground breaking, but not bad either.
