In these days of ECMAScript 6, it's nice to see where a bunch of ideas of it came from.

Coffee is a lot like the new JavaScript standard (just a bit more brackets). The book manages to explain and show all the little nice things about it, keeping a single application from start to finish, which helps a lot in understanding the flows of it.

I just got a bit miffed with the upbeat tone of the book. It's not a full Pollyanna, but a lot of "that looks a lot cleaner, don't it?" and "It's even prettier than normal Javascript" gets into you pretty quick.
