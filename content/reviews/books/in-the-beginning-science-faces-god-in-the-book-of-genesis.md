I'm really a fan of Asimov books and I was really eager to read some of his non-fiction books.

On this book, he discusses the Genesis, the first book of the bible. The weird thing is that the introduction makes it seem like he will use the bible as a starting point for science -- the introduction mentions that the people who wrote the bible were not stupid, and they were the most smart people at the time -- so I was expecting it to be more like "they thought this, but now we know this". It wasn't like this; but it was really interesting for pointing what was in the bible and what know at the time.

So although it is not a journey to the science, its a really interesting journey to history in the region were the bible was written.
