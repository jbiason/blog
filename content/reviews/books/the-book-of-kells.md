[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/941468.The_Book_of_Kells):
An unusual and original work of fantasy from the acclaimed author of Tea with
the Black Dragon. A contemporary man, John Thornburn (a meek, non-violent and
unpredictable artist) and woman, Derval (his tough, confrontational, strong
and warrior-like lover) time travel to ancient Ireland to avenge a Viking
attack. Packed with fascinating details of historical time and place in Irish
history and delicately balanced on the border between realism and fantasy, the
story centers around one of the most famous and beautiful illuminated
manuscripts in history, the legendary but entirely real Book of Kells. Celtic
history blends with magical fantasy for a strange and immersive tale of
adventure.

I really don't know how to categorize this book.

I mean, for a while, I thought it was a serious fantasy book. Then things got
way crazy and I thought it was a comedy. Exactly at that point, craziness went
out and things were not funny anymore.

Maybe the guy just read too much Irish tales and decided to write about it,
since there are very few books in which the story happens in Ireland.

In the end, sure, it's a story around some Irish tales, based on Irish history
and, basically, that. It's crazy, it's hard to follow and jumps around too
much.
