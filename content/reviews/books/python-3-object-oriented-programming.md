After a bunch of titles from Packt, I expected something that would be half OO, half Python 3. But I got a very happy surprise reading the book because it does really go intro OO, explaining from analysis to design to code and then slowly dwelving into Python around those topics.

Not only that, but instead of simply assuming his position is right, the author explores other possibilites and than moves back when something doesn't work -- kinda like _Robert C. Martin_ does in _Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship_.

In the end, even after I work with Python for 5+ years, I still learnt a few more things about using Python for OO development (and really got in agreement with the author when OO isn't necessary!)
