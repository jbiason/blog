There are two simple words to describe this book: Galaxy Quest.

And then, they aren't.

"It's complicated", are some characters in the book say over and over again.

But the first part is. And it's too damn hilarious -- if you're a Star Trek fan, that is. Or some of the lesser sci-fi series.

But the story picks up every absurd psedo-science and plot twist from the series and extrapolates to the silliest level possible. I can't remember the last time a book made me laugh.

It's silly. It's funny. It's the Galaxy Quest for every sci-fi series in the planet.

And, then, after the curtains close... It goes into a deep, touching story about... life, basically. You think you're done, but then it gets deeper and serious and... touching, basically.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. And my reading statuses for this book proves it.
