Another Erlang book for my collection.

This one takes its time to explain every point. So if you like to go fast and
furious, that's not it. Also, because I read some other books (ok, "book")
about Erlang, some topics felt a little bit boring, 'cause I did get the point
already.

Also, it seems this books also suffer from the "let me use the shell to explain
this point". It's not that bad when you want to show a point in the very
beginning and then just drop it ('cause, you know, you won't use the shell as
part of your application -- you may use as a helper to figure out when things
go haywire, but not as a default tool) but not when you're near the middle of
the book explaining some important topic, like supervisors.

But, at the same time, some topics that the other books (ok, "book") completely
ignored, like "how do you build, package and deploy an Erlang application".

But yeah, the "using shell for important stuff" *really* annoyed me.
