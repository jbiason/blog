It's kinda weird to read a book that your experience agrees with what it is
said: I have a collection of things I learnt in 30 years doing software
development, and a lot of things said in the book agree with it.

Now, because there are several authors, the writing style changes a lot: Some
are really dense and difficult to follow, some others are simple and fun to
read, and some feel really repetitive.

One of the downsides of the book is that they should get a more diverse group.
Sure, Uncle Bob is highly influential and has a lot of good tips, but giving
him 3 articles, when there are only 6 women and 2 black men in the list of
authors seems kinda a waste[^1].

Sure, for people starting in the development world, it's a good book, giving
some pointers on where to start, but for people who are in the area for some
time (and may already read some books/posts about the topics), it may feel a
bit like a waste of time.

[^1]: No, I'm not saying that Uncle Bob isn't worth getting 3 spots, so maybe
  the list should have more than 97 points to let others also have a spot.
