Yes, I know I said I wouldn't read those books anymore. But I tagged them on
my storage in "to be read" and, bored I decided to pick another one.

And, this time, I'm not reading any more books of the series.

Once again, the story moves backwards -- without telling you this -- to tell
you a story behind some other character... well character*s* actually, 'cause,
once again, a bunch of characters are introduced and them relegated to
disappear in the background, like previous books.

Maybe the author was trying to -- and yes, I know I said this of the previous
book -- make some "Shadow of the Giant" type of connection between the
stories. But, once again, it focus on things you already know, adding
absolutely nothing to the main story. It is just noise around the original
one. Besides, deep, complicated points are still unresolved: How the fuck did
Erebus got into contact with the chaos? What the fuck is the chaos? This is
open for three books (counting this one) and still no answer at all.

The first book of the series introduced a character that had to live under the
control of more powerful characters, which could give the reader some idea of
the intricacies of the politics without ever talking about the politicians...
And then suddenly everything was dropped and forgotten and now you have even a
battle between two powerful entities -- the primarchs -- happening, like
everyone else was just background.

And boy, the general description of those primarchs is that they are a bunch
of assholes. All of them. To the point that you start to believe that even the
emperor, which command the primarchs, is also an asshole. They are so
asshole-ly than, at this point of the series, I want the whole universe to
burn, starting with the fucking damn Astares.

Oh, and the great plot twist in the end can be seen from a mile, as long as
you're paying half attention to the story.

So... fuck it, the series is dead and buried for real at this point for me.
I can't even recommend any of the book in the series at this point, so rubbish
the story has become.
