One book that came with a Humble Bundle. 

Although the title may sound a bit of feminist, the book has nothing about it.
Surely, it breaks the mold of “princesses are nice and quiet and beautiful and
a man saves them in the end”, but some of the examples are not role models. 

Princesses that were crazy. Princesses that were princesses just because they
lied about it. Princesses that acted more like men. Sadly, there are were few
Princess (later queen) Victoria, a princess that proved her worth. 

Still, is a curious history book.
