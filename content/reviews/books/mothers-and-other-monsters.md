I now there are stories with a hidden subject, like "Arrival", in which the
fact that understanding how the alien language works allow humans to break the
barriers of time, and one could expect that stories with no eminent subject
actually have a hidden one.

But I feel that doesn't happen here.

There are just... stories. And, sad to say, they are not even good.

There are points that never lead to anywhere, and doesn't seem related to the
main history; most of them end with no conclusion at all (will the clone die?
What will happen to the daredevil? Do the husband got cured from Alzheimer and
would he still be in love with his wife?)
