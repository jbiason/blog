[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34013923-learn-amazon-web-services-in-a-month-of-lunches):

AWS gives users the networking, compute, and security services they need without
making them pay for anything they're not actually using. With almost a hundred
individual AWS services, putting all the pieces together is not a simple
thing. That's where this book can help.

Some points here:

* (-) Lots of screenshots. I know this is just a personal issue, not something
  that is inherent bad, but I have to put this as a negative point for two
  reasons: First, these images are very low quality in the ePub version; Second,
  the book focuses too much on the screenshots, without focusing on what the
  problem, solution and concepts are; "Click there, type this, click complete"
  happens a lot in the book, which shouldn't be bad if, at least, it explained
  why you clicked there and typed that. I'm not even sure if the images are
  still up to date -- some references are really out of date already, like
  saying to use Ubuntu 16.04. It would be a lot more useful to explain the
  concepts and then show how to apply them, either by using the web interface of
  the command line interface.

* (-) Speaking of command line, the book praises the tool, have a full chapter
  about it, tell how good it is and then... nothing. The following chapters
  completely ignore it. Again, this seem like a missed oportunity to explain
  concepts and then show how to apply them using the web interface and the CLI
  tool.

* (-) I'm not sure who is the target audience for the book. I mean, some things
  seem to be dumbed down to make easier for people who don't know the technology
  to understand what's going on, but... would someone that isn't related to the
  development of an application, that haven't seen or heard about databases and
  stuff worry about using AWS? 'Cause that's who the book seems focused on:
  people who just want something on the internet, but have no idea what they
  want or how to make it work.

(As a side note, the WordPress install could be completely moved to an appendix
and keep going with just the concepts.)

* (-) Some things doesn't seem related to AWS itself. For example, the second
  chapter is only about installing WordPress on a Linux server, and it could be
  done in any Linux install, even VirtualBox. This is kinda related to the
  previous point: If someone was attached the development of some web
  application, saying that you need a database and PHP and related libraries
  would be enough; but when you have to explain the whole install of
  WordPres... what's the focus?

The small bits of concepts that are scattered around the images are somewhat
interesting, but because they are so tied to the screenshots, a lot of
information could be just missed. Or worse, turn people into simple clickers
that don't understand why they are clicking this or that button, 'cause all they
learnt was that they should click that button.
