This is the second book about Backbone and, honestly, the more I read, the
less I understand about it; but I believe that's absolutely only my fault.

Although the book explains each of the Backbone classes in deep, it never
really connects one to another. It seriously lack a whole description on how
to build an app from start to finish. Even if you know everything about
collections and models (and that they represent a table and a record,
respectively), how to create a View and how to route things around, you
seriously lack the idea behind connecting one to another -- although Views are
shown using Models directly, it should actually go on how to draw several
models from a collection in a single step, for example.

So, although good for understanding Backbone classes, it lacks on the general
*building* of a Backbone app.
