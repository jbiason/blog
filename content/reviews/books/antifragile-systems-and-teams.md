Not really a book, just a paper. But a badly constructed paper.

It doesn't describe what an "antifragile system" is in deep (ok, it's a paper); lists only two examples of antifragile systems; focus too much on devops.

Sadly, nothing useful -- something you can take with you and use when building your own system or leading your team -- in this.
