[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22466476-antifragile-systems-and-teams):
All complex computer systems eventually break, despite all of the
heavy-handed, bureaucratic change-management processes we throw at them. But
some systems are clearly more fragile than others, depending on how well they
cope with stress. In this Oâ€™Reilly report, Dave Zwieback explains how the
DevOps methodology can help make your system antifragile.

Not really a book, just a paper. But a badly constructed paper.

It doesn't describe what an "antifragile system" is in deep (ok, it's a
paper); lists only two examples of antifragile systems; focus too much on
devops.

Sadly, nothing useful -- something you can take with you and use when building
your own system or leading your team -- in this.
