A science book like no other, The Where, the Why, and the How turns loose 75 of
today's hottest artists onto life's vast questions, from how we got here to
where we are going. Inside these pages some of the biggest (and smallest)
mysteries of the natural world are explained in essays by real working
scientists, which are then illustrated by artists given free rein to be as
literal or as imaginative as they like. The result is a celebration of the
wonder that inspires every new discovery. Featuring work by such contemporary
luminaries as Lisa Congdon, Jen Corace, Neil Farber, Susie Ghahremani,
Jeremyville, and many more, this is a work of scientific and artistic
exploration to pique the interest of both the intellectually and imaginatively
curious.

(This is getting quite common on my reviews but) This is a weird book.

Now, don't get me wrong: The idea the title gives is that they are going to
give you the where, the why and the how, but they actually mean the questions
"where", "why" and "how". A lot of the answers is, basically, "we don't know
yet" -- which, by the way, is completely fine, specially when dealing with
proper science.

Also, the questions are not really "trivia"-like: they go more deep than simply
"Why are plants green?" and the like. And, because you have no certain
questions, it gets even more nerd-like -- which, again, is completely fine.

(Also, the illustrations: meh)
