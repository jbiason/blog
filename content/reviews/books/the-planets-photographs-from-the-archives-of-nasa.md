If I said this book was only about pictures of the several rocks in our solar
system, I'd seriously not right -- although the book is (mostly) it.

Besides gorgeous images of the planets in the solar system, including, Ceres,
Pluto, the Sun and even comet 67P, it also has information about what you're
seeing: The icy plains of Pluto (you know, the heart shaped thing), the size
and speed of Jupiter huge storm and everything else you can think of.

This is the kind of book you should buy in large sheets and put on your coffee
table, not only to impress your guests, but also to remind you of how big the
space is.
