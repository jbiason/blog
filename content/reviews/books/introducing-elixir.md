[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18194084-introducing-elixir):
Authors Simon St. Laurent and J. David Eisenberg show you how to write simple
Elixir programs by teaching you one skill at a time. You'll learn about
pattern matching, recursion, message passing, process-oriented programming,
and establishing pathways for data rather than telling it where to go. By the
end of your journey, you'll understand why Elixir is ideal for concurrency and
resilience.

In a way, this is an "Introducing" book, so one shouldn't expect some deep
knowledge about the language after reading it.  But also, sometimes it feels a
bit too "shallow" to gather some proper understanding of the language. 

One thing that kept bugging me was the fact that code kept changing: Not in
the "going forward" kind of change, which is good, explain the basic, then
start adding more complex/shorter solutions, but "let me bend this to another
direction and completely ignore that direction later".

But to get a "feeling" of the language, it is a good book.
