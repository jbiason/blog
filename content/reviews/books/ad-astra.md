While short stories may not give a general sense of the whole -- 'cause they
are, after all, short -- the stories here are very interesting, and very good
sci-fi.

Honestly, it's really hard to give some indication of how the stories go
without going into spoilers.

But, again, there are very good stories, some even touching, some discussing
social issues (without being "in your face", like any good Star Trek episode).

And the narration is pretty good too. Easy to read, easy to keep going.
