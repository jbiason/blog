It's "The Big Bad Book of Bill Murray", but for Christopher Walken: Stories,
people, movies, things related to the Christopher Walken, in alphabetical
order.

Is it good? Well, that's the point I can really say. One thing that annoys me
is that most of what is said in the book comes from other sources; Walken is
never interviewed, but all the information is taken from other books and
interviews and whatnot, but nothing directly said for the book. Also, because
I'm not a super-fan, I can't validate if things are interesting or not, so it
ends up being a compilation of information about an (recluse, private) actor.

It may be good if you just found out about Christopher Walken and want some
opinion about his movies, and what to watch next and such and get some
information in the more boring scenes.
