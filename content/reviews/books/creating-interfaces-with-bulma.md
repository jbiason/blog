Everybody is looking for that most awesome, small CSS framework, that will
solve all your problems. Is Bulma this framework? Well, I'm not sure.

It's not that the book doesn't show what the framework can do, it's just that
the examples seem really without any checking: Sometimes fields are surrounded
by one "field" div, sometimes they are surrounded by "column" (a normal grid
component) and sometimes they are surrounded by two "field" divs. Why? Which
one is the right way? It is a problem with the framework or a problem with the
book?

Also, there is a weird example of just writing templates with no explanation
on why: Why one should replace "6 books" to "3 customers"? Does that change
anything? (It does not, I do understand the why doing it, but there is no
explanation that you're doing it just to show how things will look like.)

Also also, there is some serious problem with the images in the ePub version:
It says something but it shows a copy of a previous image. Surely, you get
what they meant by some template changes in a way that you don't need to see
the results, but still...
