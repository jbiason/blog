In my teens, I got two Spirit books on a sale. 

I absolutely loved the story and the lines. It was my first experience with adult comics: Color only when really needed, deep story without a good vs evil (well, it was, but it was not all black and white), excellent drawing...

This is not it.

This is nothing like the original Spirit.

This is a sad rip off.
