[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14553581-k-is-for-knifeball)
From the authors of the breakout bestseller All my friends are dead. (more
than 175,000 copies sold) and in the humorous vein of Go the F**k to Sleep
comes a laugh-out-loud collection of bad advice that turns the children's
alphabet book on its head. Adorable illustrated characters lead readers down a
path of poor decision-making, and alphabetical, rhyming couplets offer
terrible life lessons in which O is for opening things with your teeth, F is
for setting Daddy's wallet on fire, and R is for Raccoon (but definitely not
for rabies). With plenty of playfully disastrous choices lurking around every
corner, this compendium of black humor may be terrible for actual children,
but it's perfect for the common-senseless child in all adults.

What would happen if you mix "Please Go To Fucking Sleep" with an ABC book? "K
is for Knifeball".

It's a "for-kids-but-not-kids" kinda of book: For example, "D is for Drifter,
which you should call to get in when your parents aren't at home" and "F is
Food, which you should give for the drifter living under your bed" (or
something around those lines)... Pretty much what "Go To Fucking Sleep" does.

Surely one wouldn't recite the book to a kid anyway, and being really short,
I'm not sure about the re-readability of it. Still, it is somewhat amusing.
