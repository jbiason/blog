Reading another "Old Man's War" after a long time since the very first is a weird experience. Mostly because you forgot half of the stuff, and the other half is buried somewhere in a fuzzy old memory.

And then the names appear in the story. And *then* you remember most of the stuff.

Thing is, this book does very little connection with the first one. While "_Old Man's War_" explored the life of a man in a new body in a very long battle, this book focuses on the other half of the book, Jane Sagan, the soldier built with the DNA of the man in the new body.

So now we have the battles of Jane Sagan as a CDF soldier. But the book is really what *people* are: The bodies? Their personality? Their memories?

Unfortunately, it doesn't go as deep as it could in this topic but, on the other hand, the story is mostly solid, the writing is easy to read and the story itself have a good pacing.
