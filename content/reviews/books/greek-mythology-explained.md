When I saw "Explained" in the title, I thought the explanations would point
things in the stories that reflected things in the Greek society at the time.

But no, explanations are way more simpler than that.

For example, the mith of Odysseus and his voyage back home, starting when he
has to choose between facing Scylla or Chyrabdis, one a monster of 6 heads and
another a huge whirlpool. The explanation: "between a rock and hard place". I
mean, it doesn't take much to realize that either option is terrible. You don't
need explanation for that.

On the other hand, some explanations are, actually, explanations about the
chosen story. Some characters in Greek mythology have different narrations for
the same story -- for example, there are, according to the book, 6 different
tales of Artemis and Orion, all with the same start, the same ending, but
different content "in between". This is nice.

And, even if the explanations aren't a huge thing, the select stories are
pretty good.
