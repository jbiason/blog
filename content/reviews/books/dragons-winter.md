[Goodreads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22746453-dragon-s-winter):
Karadur and Tenjiro are twin sons of Kojiro Antani, the dragon lord of Ippa.
But only Karadur, whose name means "fire-bringer," bears the blood of the
dragon in his veins. His younger brother, Tenjiro or "Heaven's hope," was
second out of the womb and is the weakest and smallest of the two. As the
twins grow to maturity, Karadur is anxious to attain the promise of his blood
and transform into the dragon he is capable of becoming. But Tenjiro, who
bears the scars of Karadur's claws, resents his older brother and, on the eve
of Karadur's transformation, steals the talisman that makes the change
possible. That same night he disappears, fleeing to a distant, icy realm where
he will reemerge as a powerful wizard bent on destroying his older brother.
But Karadur, lord of Dragon Keep, is prepared to go to war against Tenjiro,
and it's likely only one will survive. --Craig Engler (less)

{{ stars(stars=3) }}

A fantasy book with changelings, a feud between brothers and a medieval
setting.

The problem? It is too cliché.

Sure it's a simple read, but the amount of clichés, like the big baddie, the
corruption of a character by some supernatural power, the character with an
immense power that he needs to learn how to control, even the freaking "let me
build a character you'll cheer for and I'll kill them" is there.
