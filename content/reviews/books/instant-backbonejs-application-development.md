Got this in a promotion, expecting to understand why I should learn backbone.

And the problem is, although the book goes into building a SPA and tells every single step, it severely lacks the "why" you should do such things. Why you should create a "Routes" property on your app; why you have collections AND models, why Backbone can't infer the collections by the models and so on.

In the end, I think I learnt more about LoDash than Backbone.
