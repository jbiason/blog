**Easy way to describe this: lazy**

You know, for a book with a subtitle of "Get efficient with your iPad, Evernote and GTD" (or, at least, that's what my edition says in the cover), I really expect something more around the lines of "Here is GTD and here is how you do this GTD thing with your iPad, and here is how you do this GTD thing inside Evernote". Instead, the book goes talking about apps that two months from now will not make sense, which are completely unrelated to each other (so good look trying to mix them together and get something meaningful), and which, most of the time, have nothing to do GTD or Evernote.

Also, there are a few quirks in the edition that really annoyed me: there some marks around the text that seems there was some editor marking down corrections to be made, but instead of checking those, the author decided to publish the book with the marks instead of the final product.

In the end, it feels like a bunch of blog posts tied together instead of something really targeted towards GTD and Evernote.
