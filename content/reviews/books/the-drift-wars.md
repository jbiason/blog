[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18188712-the-drift-wars):
Peter Garvey was just a kid when the warships emerged from the Drift and
devastated his homeworld. He enlisted immediately, leaving behind his
small-town life to fight in distant space.

Barely surviving basic training, he is thrust to the front line to battle the
Riel, an army of creatures beyond his darkest nightmares.

There are very few books that I've read that made my head spin by being so
terrible describing action scenes. There is _Neuromancer_ has pretty damn good
action sequences. This one, no.

Maybe it's because you can't really get the pace of the sequence. Maybe it's
because it's badly described. Maybe it's because things sound so cartoonish
you can't really go. I mean, how can I imagine an action sequence when the big
bad guy seems to be a Spidermon from Doom on steroids, the middle guys felt
like Carnage from Spiderman and the mind-guys seemed copies of Mordin from
Mass Effect.

And let's not forget the main plot machine, which makes absolutely no sense at
all -- even if it's a pretty damn concept to keep the story flowing.

Speaking of flowing, if you take the heavy packed sequences and the enemies
description, it's a pretty damn good book. Almost like "All You Need Is Kill"
in structure and plot advancement.

So it's not a bad book at all, and may feel like a really good read if you
managed to follow Neuromancer sequences.
