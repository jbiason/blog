I must say, I'm confused about something: Either the book is really shallow or there are no "gotchas" with Meteor. 'Cause the book goes all the way from creating a single application from start to end, keep it straight, doesn't add any bullshit, add external dependencies, packages it and then deploys either on the meteor structure or in custom server.

So, again, either Meteor is so simple that everything is already packaged or the book is shallow and doesn't go deep into problems you may find. I can't really know, after reading it, which one (although I'd bet my money on the first).
