I got this book from a Humble Bundle of Scifi/Fantasy. It fits in the later than in the former.

The biggest problem I found was that the story starts midway. Surely, this is not something new, as other books take the same approach and then, slowly, expand the reader knowledge about the story universe. But the problem here is "slowly". Part of what is going on (and *why* is going on) is told very late in the story.

Also, the end, although manages to capture your attention, is cliche at best.
