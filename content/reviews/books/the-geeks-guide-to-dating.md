I have to be honest: The first 1/3 of the book was quite boring. If you ever
read any other dating-advice book, there is a lot of same tips: Listen to her,
find some common ground, etc, etc, etc. All that with heavy drops of geek/nerd
culture: game references, movie references, book references and the continuous
use of referring to the reader as "Player One" (ok, I get it: People are trying
to get their "Player Two", but heck, calm the freaking down).

The later parts are a bit better, going off the common ground: casual dating,
second date, how to dress, how to make things work when things get serious, what
you should be looking for a long term relationship and how to act when things
fall down -- either by your own decision or theirs.

But there is something off here: Sure, it is somewhat fun getting ideas using
analogies based on nerd stuff (again, games, movies and books), but the whole
thing seems focused on geek guys, and I feel it would be really interesting, as
a guy, to understand the female perspective of this all. The book tries
(*tries*) to make things a bit less biased by adding a disclaimer that geek
girls can also read the book, and should just replace the "she/her" to
"he/him" -- which absolutely does not work on some chapters, like the "How to
Dress" part.

And yes, the heavy use of drop/nerd references in the first half does not help
the lighter use in the second half: You're already tired of reading about Mario
or Sonic or whatever.

I'm going to give a 3 star just because it does the extra mile of going to
different ideas of dating (serious vs casual), dealing with things going serious
and breakups.
