One of the books from the "Trivia Champion" Humble Bundle. And yes, it belongs
to a "Trivia Champion" bundle.

The whole book consists on small stories about random objects: The smiley face,
the revolver, the hydrant, the wipper, all consist in a small story behind it
or some anecdote, like a campus on war due a water gun.

The stories are small and funny.

The only problem I had (and, again, personal problem) is that it is too
American-centric. I mean, the whole war on a water gun mentions an American
university; Dr Pepper is mostly unknown in Brazil; 90% of the people mentioned
are American -- and, by the way, the little anecdote about the water gun has
absolutely no relation to the creation of the product.
