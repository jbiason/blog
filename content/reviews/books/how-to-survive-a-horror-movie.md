Honestly, I'm not sure who this book is targeted at.

At first, I thought it would examine all the clich√©s on horror movies that
made the hero survive everything till the end. But the narration style
sometimes puts you as just someone living in the same world, sometimes it puts
you as the protagonist, sometimes you can engineer your way around every
problem, sometimes you have to force the screenwriter to do something (so you
don't actually _do_ whatever you need to do, you force someone else to make
you do something), sometimes you force the "movie" to move faster without the
screenwriter support... It is a huge hodgepodge of ways, and no consistency
between them.

To be fair, I'm not a fan of horror movies (the book came from a Humble Bundle
pack) so I may appear a bit hard on the author, but still...
