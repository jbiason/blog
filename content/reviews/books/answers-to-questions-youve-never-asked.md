[GoodReads summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36049427-answers-to-questions-you-ve-never-asked):
Fun facts for kids of all ages: When you take the most absurd parts of history,
science, economics and geography, you end up with a pretty confusing picture of
humanity. Why do we have borders, what’s the furthest you can get from the
ocean, how do you qualify as a country and why did Vikings wear those silly
helmets? These are just a few of the strange questions that bounce around the
head of YouTube sensation Joseph Pisenti, aka RealLifeLore.

Another trivia book. And this one is... weird.

Instead of coming directly with trivia, the book focus on the *history*
behind the fact (e.g., the size of the Roman Empire is giving talking about the
annexed countries). On the other hand, the way to get to the history is
strange, to say the least: How many countries today would encompass the Roman
Empire, if it didn't fall?

Also, the last 1/3 of the book is devoted to American presidents, which is
interesting... if you're American.

(And yes, I know I'm picky about this kind of stuff, but some one *has* to
be, right?)
