[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10326288-broetry-poetry-for-dudes):
As contemporary poets sing the glories of birds, birch trees, and
menstruation, regular guys are left scratching their heads. Who can speak for
Everyman? Who will articulate his love for Xbox 360, for Mama Celeste's frozen
pizza, for the cinematic oeuvre of Bruce Willis?

Don't let the title fool you: It may sound like a book with bro-dude stuff,
like women being bitches, the parties all nights to get bitches and so on, but
there is none of this here.

It's more about life, about growing up, with some fun tones -- I specially
recommend the one that describes a whole life in 3 or so pages using only
movie titles.
