I know that "succinctly"doesn't mean "let's explore everything", but there are some things that really need some better explanations.

First of all, this is not a book for starters. If you never coded in your live, getting the basics will be really hard. Second, there are some things that, because you already coded, look a bit weird in the way that either C# is a magical language or there is something really wrong with the code.
