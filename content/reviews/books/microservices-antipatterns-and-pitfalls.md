[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31291348-microservices-antipatterns-and-pitfalls):
Remember when service-oriented architecture (SOA) was all the rage? Companies
jumped in before fully understanding SOA’s advantages and disadvantages, and
struggled to make this complex architecture work. Today, we’re poised to
repeat this same experience with microservices—only this time we’re prepared.
With this concise ebook, author Mark Richards walks you through the ten most
common microservice anti-patterns and pitfalls, and provides solutions for
avoiding them.

Not a book per se, but a paper about the tendencies that lead to microservices
to fail. If this was a book, I think I'd give it less stars, but since it is
just a short paper, it feels alright -- for a book, longer content and how to
implement the corrects would be nicer.

In the end, for people starting with microservices, it is a good pointer for
"do not do that"; for people working with microservices for awhile, it's quite
a "I did that already" checklist.
