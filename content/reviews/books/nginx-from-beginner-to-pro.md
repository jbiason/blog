[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30892392-nginx):
Teaches you to start up Nginx and quickly take your expertise to a level where
you can comfortably work with various aspects of the web server and make
informed design decisions for your web farm. Nginx powers more than 40% of the
top 1000 websites and is among the handful of web servers that can handle more
than 10K simultaneous connections. It has some features which are simply
unparalleled.

Seriously, I had to read this with a lot of self control, because there was so
much bullshit. I mean, you don't need to know Nginx to understand that the PID
file is used to know if the process is running (in the most simple case) but
the book tries to sell it as a way to check process uptime. I mean, seriously?
Of all the things, Nginx will create a PID file simply for you to check its
uptime?

This kind of thing keeps going on and on. It feels like the author didn't know
Nginx at all and was figuring out as the book was being written; when they had
no idea what one thing meant, bullshit was used to fill the blanks.

This means two things: One, there is so much bullshit it is painful. Second,
the book only gets reasonably good at the end. But still hardly anything near
the "Pro" as used in the title.
