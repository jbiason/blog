I'll be honest and say that I did expect a bit more about this book.

It is not a book talking about changes in the last few years in the VIM
workflow; it's more about the changes in the ecosystem of VIM. So instead of
focusing on new features (say, from last version and current version), it
focuses a lot more on plugins.

Not that focusing on (recent) plugins is a bad thing: There were changes in the
infrastructure of VIM that allowed the creation of more modern and flexible
plugins and talking about them is a good thing. But, again, I expected a more
focused book on VIM than plugins. If the title were "Craft your VIM environment
on VIM 8 and Neovim", it would fit perfectly on what the book presents, for
example.

In all, it's not a bad book, although it requires that you know VIM beforehand.
