I'm not a fan of zombie movies/books. But I'm a Star Trek fan. And oh boy,
this is a fun book.

While some events in the story may be too cliché (specially in the zombie
genre), the way the author interweaves with Star Trek philosophy and Trek
fandom is brilliant. And also gets bonus points for not doing "A red shirt on
the Enterprise gets infected with a virus and starts zombifying everyone";
instead, it takes the *fandom* and infects its.

And while the cliché parts, although cliché, fit the story, the fact that the
author also goes into deep in what Star Trek is and what it represents to its
fans, it's pretty damn amazing.

I really really liked it.
