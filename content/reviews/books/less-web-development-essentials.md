Less is a compiler for CSS. Why do I feel I need to start a review with that?
Because this book focuses a lot more on CSS than Less. Actually, I may have
learnt more about CSS than what it was expected to learn. There is nothing
wrong talking more about the base technology when the piece you're talking
about is built on it, but when you talk a lot more about the first and not the
second, you have to seriously reconsider your book title. 

Another thing that annoys me is when the author keeps talking about the
examples outside the book. "Check the examples which you can download in the
previous URL" is lazy explanation. Instead of building knowledge blocks and
then expand over them, the book uses the lazy escape of not telling you
anything and expecting yo to read things somewhere else. 

In the end, it's a nice book to learn a thing or two about modern CSS, but
barely something good about Less.
