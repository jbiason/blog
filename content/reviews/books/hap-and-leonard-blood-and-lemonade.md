[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31921113-blood-and-lemonade):
Hap Collins is a complicated man. He looks like a good ‘ol boy, but his
politics don’t match. After way too many jobs, Hap has discovered what he’s
best at: kicking ass. Vietnam veteran Leonard Pine is even more complicated:
black, Republican, gay—and an occasional arsonist. As childhood friends and
business associates, Hap and Leonard have a gift for the worst kind of
trouble: East Texan trouble.

Another book that came from a Humble Bundle. 

It's weird that a book about a couple of disfunctional investigators have
absolutely nothing about investigating stuff. I mean, sure, it's a solo book
and may fit in the general sense of the series, but for someone coming from
outside, it's weird that they try to capture readers by something the series
is not.

On the other hand, the stories are well formed and easy to read and paint a
long story of the old days in America (which I suppose it's true, 'cause I
never lived in the United States, much less in that time).
