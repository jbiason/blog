Another book that came from a Humble Bundle. 

It's weird that a book about a couple of disfunctional investigators have absolutely nothing about investigating stuff. I mean, sure, it's a solo book and may fit in the general sense of the series, but for someone coming from outside, it's weird that they try to capture readers by something the series is not.

On the other hand, the stories are well formed and easy to read and paint a long story of the old days in America (which I suppose it's true, 'cause I never lived in the United States, much less in that time).
