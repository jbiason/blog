For a long time, I've only heard about "Have No Mouth", but never actually read it -- and, to be completely honest, didn't even know it was a story.

And then I got a fiction humble bundle and there it was.

I must say I'm impressed with Harlan writing style. It's easy to read, not too messy and straight -- a thing that reminds me of the way Asimov writes, which allowed me to read whole books in a couple of days.

The stories are all over the place, though: One is scifi, another is hallucinogenic, another is modern fiction... So all tastes should be satiated in the end.
