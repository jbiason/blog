[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18405331-typescript-succinctly):
The extensive adoption of JavaScript for application development, and the
ability to use HTML and JavaScript to create Windows Store apps, has made
JavaScript a vital part of the Windows development ecosystem. Microsoft has
done extensive work to make JavaScript easier to use. Microsoft's TypeScript
extends many familiar features of .NET programming to JavaScript. With
TypeScript Succinctly by Steve Fenton, you will learn how TypeScript provides
optional static typing and classes to JavaScript development, how to create
and load modules, and how to work with existing JavaScript libraries through
ambient declarations. TypeScript is even significantly integrated with Visual
Studio to provide the autocompletion and type checking you are most
comfortable with.

Without jumping into too much detail, the book gives a little introduction to
TypeScript, without the whole bullshit other books like to add. So it is that
I probably highlighted the whole thing.

Don't expect to go deep into TypeScript and all its nuances, though.
