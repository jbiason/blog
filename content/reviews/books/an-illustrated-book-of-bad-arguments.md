[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18753581-an-illustrated-book-of-bad-arguments):
This book is aimed at newcomers to the field of logical reasoning,
particularly those who, to borrow a phrase from Pascal, are so made that they
understand best through visuals. I have selected a small set of common errors
in reasoning and visualized them using memorable illustrations that are
supplemented with lots of examples. The hope is that the reader will learn
from these pages some of the most common pitfalls in arguments and be able to
identify and avoid them in practice.

Short, but fun.

It's a really fun read, but really really short (I managed to read the whole
thing in about 40 minutes). I expected a little bit more, some more examples,
some other types of fallacies and so on.

It's not that the book is bad, quite the contrary. It's a fun read.

But short.
