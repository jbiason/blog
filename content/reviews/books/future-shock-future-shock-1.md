The basic plot is: A group of teens with special talents is chosen to go to the future but something something and then they are happily ever after.

So... Yes, it's a time travel story, but it goes to the future instead of the past, which is something new for me. And there is a plot twist in the end, but it's not big. And the protagonists are teens and, even if it's explained why (with a bunch of technobabble, that is)... meh. And their "talents" are not that so important to the plot -- if they were some very clever adults, the plot would still work the same.

But the writing is pretty damn good, even when it lags in the end and you feel you can jump whole paragraphs without missing the story. But it's not crumpled, and it's not full of useless descriptions.
