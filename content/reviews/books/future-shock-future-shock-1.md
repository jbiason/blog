[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26722944-future-shock):
Elena Martinez has street smarts, the ability for perfect recall, and a
deadline: if she doesn’t find a job before she turns eighteen, she’ll be
homeless. But then she gets an unexpected offer from Aether Corporation, the
powerful Los Angeles tech giant. Along with four other recruits—Adam, Chris,
Trent, and Zoe—Elena is being sent on a secret mission to bring back data from
the future. All they have to do is get Aether the information they need, and
the five of them will be set for life. It’s an offer Elena can’t refuse.

The basic plot is: A group of teens with special talents is chosen to go to
the future but something something and then they are happily ever after.

So... Yes, it's a time travel story, but it goes to the future instead of the
past, which is something new for me. And there is a plot twist in the end, but
it's not big. And the protagonists are teens and, even if it's explained why
(with a bunch of technobabble, that is)... meh. And their "talents" are not
that so important to the plot -- if they were some very clever adults, the
plot would still work the same.

But the writing is pretty damn good, even when it lags in the end and you feel
you can jump whole paragraphs without missing the story. But it's not
crumpled, and it's not full of useless descriptions.
