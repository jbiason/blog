[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059137-oh-myyy):
How did a 75-year old actor from Star Trek become a social media juggernaut?
Why does everything he posts spread like wildfire across the ether, with tens
or even hundreds of thousands of likes and shares? And what can other sites,
celebrities and companies do to attain his stratospheric engagement levels,
which hover or top 100 percent while theirs languish in the single digits?

Ok, totally my fault, but I bought the book expecting a bit about Takei
history, but all I got was "how to be successful on Facebook".

Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book. It's easy to read and have its fun
moments, but there is nothing about Takei himself -- again, my fault, I was
expecting a biography when I didn't read the summary.
