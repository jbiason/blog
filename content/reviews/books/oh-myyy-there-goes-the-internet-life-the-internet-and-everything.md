Ok, totally my fault, but I bought the book expecting a bit about Takei history, but all I got was "how to be successful on Facebook".

Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book. It's easy to read and have its fun moments, but there is nothing about Takei himself -- again, my fault, I was expecting a biography when I didn't read the summary.
