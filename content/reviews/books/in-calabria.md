[OpenLibrary Summary](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27229983M/In_Calabria):
"Claudio Bianchi has lived alone for many years on a hillside in Southern
Italy's scenic Calabria. Set in his ways and suspicious of outsiders, Claudio
has always resisted change, preferring farming and writing poetry. But one
chilly morning, as though from a dream, an impossible visitor appears at the
farm. When Claudio comes to her aid, an act of kindness throws his world into
chaos. Suddenly he must stave off inquisitive onlookers, invasive media, and
even more sinister influences" -- provided by publisher.

So, this is not *really* a book, but a novella. And that's no shame.

For all that's worth, the writing is pretty good and makes the things really
flow, although it gets a bit messy in the end, in the climatic scene. Also, I'm
pretty sure there the author messed with some of main character cats at some
point.

The story is quite simple and, for someone from an Italian family, feels quite
at home. But, for all that's worth, it is kinda weird that Italians, in Italy,
speak in English, but use Italian for emotional effect.
