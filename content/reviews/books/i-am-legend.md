[GoodReads Summary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40940649-i-am-legend):
Robert Neville is the last living man on Earth... but he is not alone. Every
other man, woman and child on the planet has become a vampire, and they are
hungry for Neville's blood.

By day he is the hunter, stalking the undead through the ruins of
civilisation. By night, he barricades himself in his home and prays for the
dawn.

Sadly, a lot of people may be driven away from the book due the movie -- which
follows a very simple plot line.

But the book does not have a simple plot line. It is complex, twisting and its
purpose only shows in the very last line. In that line, the whole story
finally clicks; all plots and twists, all descriptions and names, everything
clicks. And you stay there, suddenly hit by its plot like a brick hitting you
in the side of your face.
