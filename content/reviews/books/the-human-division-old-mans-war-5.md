In "Zoe's Tale", Scalzi mentions that he wanted to get away from John Perry
and Jane, so the book is the same as The Last Colony, but from Zoe's point of
view.

This tendency keeps going on here, as it focus on Harry Wilson, one of John
Perry mates in the first book -- and heck if I could remember that if the book
haven't told me.

The book is full of action, but its ending is kinda deceptive: It doesn't
close the ties it opened, it just leaves a huge plot without explanation --
and one can assume it just something to bridge to the next book, [book:The End
of All Things|23168809].
