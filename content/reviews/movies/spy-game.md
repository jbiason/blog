In this episode of Spy Game:... Wait, I mean... In this movie, Robert Redford
plays a retiring spy that, in his last day in the office, finds out his
protégé, played by Brad Pitt was captured. While trying to save him, each
episode... I mean... 

Ok, fuck it, ok? The movie feels like someone wrote three-to-four episodes of a
TV series and, when he couldn't sell it, turned into a movie. This makes the
movie feel like a bunch of unconnected stories instead of one single story.
While trying to explain why Redford character would care about Pitt character,
they throw a bunch of stories about the way they met, how they worked together,
their quarrels, and so on.

Sure, you can explain the very last thing through a series of events, and some
movies did this pretty fine (including showing things out of order, like "Pulp
Fiction" and "Memento"), but here, again, it feels like someone wrote a series
about spies in the CIA, with a mentor and his replacement and tried to make a
movie out of.

It even feels like Redford and Pitt tried their best to portrait a grizzly spy
veteran who-have-seen-it-all and new trained spy who-still-cares-about-people,
the stories doesn't help. And some stuff is just plain bad, like the uncanny
ability of Redford character to read titles of papers showing in window
reflections, to the surprise of everyone in the room.
