headquarters, to conversations with an Iranian Ayatollah, Indian film censors
and Chinese news editors. Norwegian filmmaker HÃ¥vard Fossum has traveled the
world to understand what censorship is, allowing the censors themselves to
state their case.

With no pretense whatsoever, I decided to watch this documentary. Its start is
a bit wobbly, making you feel like you just jumped in the middle of something
else. But also, in the very start, lies the kernel of the movie.

It all start with some Neo-nazi march. And there, it lies the question:
Shouldn't those people be censored for spewing their hate? And thus start a
quest to see how some countries do their censorship: What is censored? What are
their rules? Do they *have* rules?

The only downside is the ending: Sure, after going to China, Iran, India and
such, you'd expect the filmmakers to go some where more "free". And, obviously,
the "free" place is not as "free" as it seems.

It's a curious documentary, with some expected results and some expected (no)
answer.
