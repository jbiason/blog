Someone is trying to be the next "Yahoo Serious", but not getting there.

Don't get fooled by the summary: It's not that the secret sect hunt demons in
the internet; the original plot do a flip that is actually pretty smart: demons
always took the bodies of humans and, in modern days, decided to live in the
internet. Why I think it is smart? 'Cause they make a pretty good case for
seeing so much hate online these days.

But while the initial setting seems pretty good, you can see that it is an
independent movie when things get shorted in some places. The movie tries to
make some technobabble of demon hunting, special gear and such, with the lack
of funding it just looks like some silly costumes.

Still, it is quite fun in some parts, and the goofy style -- which the actors
also seem to grasp and act on it -- make a somewhat nice comedy.
