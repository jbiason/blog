[Wikipedia Summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Escort_(2015_film)):

Journalist Mitch is a sex addict. When he is fired, he applies for a job with a
magazine. The editor promises to hire him if he writes a more interesting
article than his competitors. He decides to write about Natalie, a
Stanford-educated escort he met by chance.

Honestly, I'm not even sure this should be a 2-star movie. I mean, look at the
plot: It's some guy and a escort and they start going together. Do you have a
feeling this would end up like [Pretty
Woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Woman)? Heck, this is even mentioned
in the movie, by Natalie/Victoria, asking if Mitch thinks this would end up like
the (other) movie.

Well, it does, and the quip in the movie doesn't do anything to soften the
slouch of clich√©s in the movie: Surely the guy who doesn't get attached to
anyone will get attached to the girl; surely the girl will rethink her
profession and only then will consider going into a relationship; surely
something will change in the girls life to make her get out of her job; surely
the attraction between them would make the guy rethink his addiction; surely
after that his relationship to those around him will get a 180 degree turn to
the best.

But the thing is... I have a crush on Lyndsy Fonseca. Not just she's pretty, her
acting doesn't look like acting. OK, it's not Donald Sutherland level of acting
but heck, the way she speaks feels like some real person, in whatever situation
she's in, speaking. It's not from this movie, but even in Kick-Ass it was pretty
damn good. There is a scene when Mitch tells, among other things, that Natalie
is pretty and she quips back "Oh, you think I'm pretty?" in a juvenile/childish
way that feels incredible natural. And that's why it is not just a single star.

Michael Doneger, Fonseca's pair, on the other hand, it is pretty hard
case. Personally -- and I'm saying this as a movie-watcher, not a movie-critic,
something that I'm not -- I can't see his acting being that good, but also the
lines feed to him -- which, apparently, were also written by him -- seem forced
and not that much natural. Sure the chemistry with Fonseca work, but the
character itself is not that good.

In the end, I guess the movie could distance itself from "Pretty Woman" by
simply not going that road: Make Mitch still be a sex addict; make Natalie still
be an escort; let their friendship/relationship not get into what the characters
are. I mean, there is something in a scene where the two are discussing clinics
for STDs and their posters. Let it continue from there. They could even keep the
relationship while keeping their problems/jobs. Make
something... different. Challenge the status quo that a relationship can't work
if one side is a sex addict and the other a hooker.

It's not a boring movie, it's just... bland.
