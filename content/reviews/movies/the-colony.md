The cinematic version of "Fallout".

Ok, not as clear as Fallout, but close enough: Instead of nuclear blast, the
world is destroyed by some ice age due climate change and groups of people now
live inside bunkers. Thing is, the bunkers can talk to each other, but they are
running low on supplies -- meds and food -- so anyone sick is "removed".

Now, that the kind of scifi I do like, even with the low budget and just a few
scenes from the big names (Lawrence Fishburne and Bill Paxton) and not-no-great
acting from the new comers.

Sure, the "threat" is never truly explained -- or, even being in my ballpark,
never caught my attention -- and never solved -- that part I'm sure -- but
still, it is another movie exploring the way people act upon survival
situations.
