A robbery gone wrong. A dead innocent. A wounded criminal. And some doctor that
miraculously lives in the middle of nowhere and that can't see he's been
followed.

And that's basically it. Everything else you can already guess: criminals would
force him to save the wounded one, he'll fight, there will be some tense
moments but, in the end, everything will end up fine. It's weird that this kind
of absolutely bland stuff still gets made. It's even weirder that someone with
a big name, like Willis, would be part of it. And, yet, there it is.

It seems nobody actually expected much of this, specially Willis. I mean, sure,
the plot is bland and all, but Willis does a recap of his work in "Unbreakable"
-- minus the power up thingy -- which feels lazy.

In the end, one hour and half waster.
