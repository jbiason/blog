{{ stars(stars=3) }}

A series about Formula, pretty close to [Drive to
Survive](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8289930/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4), although the
later focuses more on the pilots and this one focuses more on the team, the
tech and the car -- and a bit on the driver.

While more interesting than "Drive To Survive" by showing the whole aspect of a
Formula 1 Team like a living organism, it falls short by looking at only one
team: McLaren. There was a great potential to make more seasons, each season
focusing on a different team and their fight in the year -- and the only team I
can think of that would have a problem with someone showing what they do is
Ferrari; all others would welcome some exposure.

So, while interesting, it was killed too soon and not explored fully.
