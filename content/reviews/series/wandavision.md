This is (I believe) the first forray of Disney into the Marvel after buying it
-- or, at least, the first outside the movies which Marvel had planned all
along.

In a way, it is a fun series, mostly 'cause you may have seen a TV series that
Wandavision is replicating. But not everything is copycating some series, there
is a story going on the side, which tries to explain why you're watching Wanda
and Vision in, say, "I Love Lucy" style, although the real reason is actually
shown in the very last episodes.

And the real reason for the multiple series is actually a pretty good reason,
but someone decided that it was time to introduce another villain, just in case
Disney decided to make a Wanda movie in the future.

In case you didn't spoil yourself yet, here it goes: Wanda is using her full
power to create an illusion in the same style of the series she watched as a
kid, after losing Vision and her brother in the movies. So the whole thing is
actually a way to deal with loss and how people search escape from the sad
feelings they feel and that affects people around -- which is a pretty large
affect part when you have magical powers.

Acting is top notch, with Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany still doing the
quality they did in the movies. The rest of the cast just follows along.

In the end, it is fun series, even when the message is pretty dark.
