What do you make when a villain actually gets popular and the person in the part
is actually liked? You turn it into a hero!

Sure, it worked wonders for Catwoman.

But yeah, this time is Loki.

For the action of taking the tesseract in "Endgame", Loki is now under arrest by
some time agency, which you never heard before, for "breaking the timeline". Of
course, the Avengers, when they broke the timeline, it was expected, so they are
Ok, but Loki is not. So, what happens? The agency hires Loki to take the other
representations of Loki, so now Loki is in to save the universe.

So, while "Falcon and the Winter Soldier" tracked the problem with the way USA
deals with black people (including black soldiers) and "Wandavision" tracked the
problem of dealing with loss, "Loki" deals with... the idea of turning a villain
into a hero for money.

Not that Tom Hiddleston let his acting down, or even Owen Wilson, but the fact
that the series was created purely to take on the popularity of Hiddleston
character is a major let down.
