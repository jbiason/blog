I have no idea who the hell watched [The Bourne
Identity](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/) and thought the cool part
wasn't Bourne/Matt Damon lightning reflexes or his uncanny ability to find an
escape, but actually the bureaucracy that created him. Probably Barney
Stinson[^1].

In a way, the series was doomed by its own format: While in a movie the actors
can film the "easy" scenes first while they train to do the most action heavy
scenes, in a series they don't have that luxury: This is the episode, and this
is what it will happen. There is no time for practicing some martial art or
take time training the movements in a scene over and over; there is very little
time between episodes and even littler time for this kind of stuff.

That's not to say that there isn't any action; there is. But is far away from
Damon's character kicking ass with a magazine.

So, the only remaining thing is the bureau and its problem. And that is a
complete drag, not even making it interesting in a mystery kind of way.
Unexpected things are happening, but the bureau moves in the pace of, well,
bureaucracy.

There is a cliffhanger in the end of the only season, and it is not even good.

[^1]: For those who haven't seen "[How I Met Your
  Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother)", there was a
  running gag in which the character played by Neil Patrick Harris named
  "Barney" would say that the real "Karate Kid" was the blonde kid played by
  William Zabka, and that the character played by Ralph Macchio was, actually,
  the bad guy.
