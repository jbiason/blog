Random thought about the previous post about "Things I Learnt The Hard Way".

<!-- more -->

When I wrote the post about "Things I Learnt The Hard Way", I never thought it
would gather the traction it did.

It was posted [on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bzipb5/things_i_learnt_the_hard_way_in_30_years_of/),
[on Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/hf0bkk/things_i_learnt_hard_way_30_years_software),
and it is being discussed on Twitter.

None of those was posted by me (except a single tweet, which didn't gather
that much attention).

Since then, I've added a bunch of new points -- as life goes on, I remember
another thing that I forgot to mention in the first time -- and when I write
this new post, the original now captures 83 (!!!) points.

But while the short format gives a quick idea of what I meant, it doesn't
properly explain the points -- and a lot of people are (correctly) raising
those in the discussion boards. So I feel I should really expand those.

And, at the same time, I have created a few macros for
[Zola](http://getzola.org/) (the blogging engine I'm using) to "publish" some
books (if you allow me to be really loose with the meaning of "publishing").

That's why I'm currently considering expanding the points in a digital book
format, also here in this blog, using each point as a chapter.

I'll still update the original post, but expanding the points into chapters
will give me more room to put my thoughts on each of them, and I can link each
point to the longer explanation.

Sounds like a plan, doesn't it?
