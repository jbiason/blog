> "Broken windows policing is at root a deeply conservative attempt to shift
> the burden of responsibility for declining living conditions onto the poor
> themselves and to argue that the solution to all social ills is increasingly
> aggressive, invasive, and restrictive forms of policing that involve more
> arrests, more harassment, and ultimately more violence.
>
> As inequality continues to increase, so will homelessness and public
> disorder, and as long as people continue to embrace the use of police to
> manage disorder, we will see a continual increase in the scope of police
> power and authority at the expense of human and civil rights."
