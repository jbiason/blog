> "The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge
> faster than society gathers wisdom"

> "The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new
> discoveries, is not "Eureka!" (I found it!) but 'That's funny ...'"

> "To surrender to ignorance and call it God has always
> been premature, and it remains premature today."

> "There's no way I can single-handedly save the world or, perhaps, even make
> a perceptible difference -- but how ashamed I would be to let a day pass
> without making one more effort."
