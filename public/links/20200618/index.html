<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages"><a href="https://altcampus.io/blog/how-to-write-good-git-commit-message">How to write good Git commit messages</a></h2>
<p>About a month ago, I shared a link describing how to make proper commit
messages, and this post talks a bit further about -- and it also cites some of
stuff I usually miss when I need to do some code review.</p>
<h2 id="ansible-tasks-vs-roles-vs-handlers"><a href="https://roelofjanelsinga.com/articles/ansible-difference-between-tasks-and-roles">Ansible: Tasks vs Roles vs Handlers</a></h2>
<p>Another &quot;I shared something like that before&quot; link, this one focuses on
Ansible itself instead of some other configuration tool. Although not deep, it
explain most of Ansible &quot;surface&quot; content.</p>
<h2 id="the-poetics-of-cli-command-names"><a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/the-poetics-of-cli-command-names/">The Poetics of CLI Command Names</a></h2>
<p>So you decided to create your own command line application to learn a new
language. Congratulations. But the success of your tool depends (partially) on
the name of it and how you consider the &quot;mystic&quot; behind it.</p>
<p>I don't fully agree with some points, though. For example, claiming <code>cfdisk</code>
was a bad choice for a curses <code>fdisk</code>; <code>fdisk</code> is well known, and using the
same name as a part of the new name shows that shows that it is a different
version and also gives information to whoever knows <code>fdisk</code> what this
application does. Same case: <code>top</code> and <code>htop</code>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-feature-flags"><a href="https://launchdarkly.com/blog/what-are-feature-flags/">What Are Feature Flags?</a></h2>
<p>Before I changed projects, we had a discussion about the way the projects were
using feature flags. </p>
<p>Although not discussed here, I do believe that feature flags should, at some
point, be removed, either by the team when a feature goes into full
availability or moved to a user configuration. But it <em>needs</em> to get out of
hands of the developers at some point and not live forever as a flag.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-minimize-rust-binary-size"><a href="https://github.com/johnthagen/min-sized-rust">How to minimize Rust binary size</a></h2>
<p>Not that Rust binaries are big -- at least, in release -- but there is always
someone complaining, specially when compared to binaries created in other
languages whose binaries are not static.</p>
<p>But it is always good to have a set of tips on how to reduce them, just in
case.</p>
<h2 id="announcing-our-rust-driver-version-1-0"><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/announcing-rust-driver-version-1">Announcing our Rust Driver: Version 1.0</a></h2>
<p>Still on Rust news, MongoDB, the company, released their official driver for
MonogDB, the database, in Rust.</p>
<p>One thing that I must say, reading the announcement, is how nice it plays with
the existing ecosystem, supporting the top async frameworks and the
serialization framework. A truly &quot;play nice with everything&quot; by the
description.</p>

<p>I have a personal project for a long time to create a command line version of
<a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>, but it seems someone had the same idea and did
the project already.</p>
