  <p>CI, Who Owns Your Data, Mac keybinds on Linux (and Windows), A Word About
Testing, Spring with GraalVM.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="the-tao-of-continuous-integration"><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2021/02/26/the-tao-of-continuous-integration/">The Tao of Continuous Integration</a></h2>
<p>Some good things here (CI needs a purpose), some not great (developers creating
workarounds the CI? How?) and no solution for those problems but, in the end,
some real things you need to keep an eye for.</p>
<h2 id="for-whom-does-data-work"><a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/for-whom-does-data-work/">For Whom Does Data Work?</a></h2>
<p>Hey, it's &quot;let's get scared about who is getting my data&quot; o'clock!</p>
<p>Ok, not that much but, once again, someone is asking who is getting some money
using information we don't know is being captured and processed about us. There
is even a discussion about different models -- but sadly leaves things like GDPR
and LGPD (the Brazilian version of GDPR) out of it.</p>
<h2 id="kinto-sh"><a href="https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto/">Kinto.sh</a></h2>
<p>A script to update your shortcuts to use the same as the Mac. This would be my
dream of using Super-C and Super-V instead of Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V -- which doesn't
work as expected in the terminal, and you have to add Shift to the equation --
but alas, it doesn't work properly on Fedora due SELinux (and heck if I'm going
to lower or disable SELinux -- my paranoid self would never allow that).</p>
<h2 id="a-short-piece-on-writing-tests"><a href="https://blog.loadzero.com/blog/on-tests/">A short piece on writing tests</a></h2>
<p>A really short piece about testing, but I surely can agree with the content of
the first line: &quot;If you're unsure of how to proceed, white a test&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="announcing-spring-native-beta"><a href="https://spring.io/blog/2021/03/11/announcing-spring-native-beta">Announcing Spring Native Beta!</a></h2>
<p>I had my time with Spring and that's one piece of software that made my life
with Java less miserable. The title was a bit misleading to me, 'cause I kinda
associated the word &quot;Native&quot; with &quot;Mobile, but in one single language&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;Native&quot; part here is actually targeting the result into a GraalVM image
instead of the war tested bytecode.</p>
<p>It's weird how GraalVM appeared and then disappeared from my radar. It was
touted as a solution for most integration systems and then... nothing. Maybe
with Spring embracing it, it would get some traction again.</p>
