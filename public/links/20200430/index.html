<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="event-driven-architecture"><a href="https://pradeeploganathan.com/architecture/event-driven-architecture/">Event Driven Architecture</a></h1>
<p>A long explanation on what Event Driven Architectures are.</p>
<p>Honestly, it is one of my favourite patterns, 'cause it allows high decoupling
of data. You have one thing creating events and you can have a lot of things
consuming those events: You can save them directly to the database; you can
make them go through a summing service, so you have the data read ready; and
so on.</p>
<h1 id="writing-safe-shell-scripts"><a href="https://sipb.mit.edu/doc/safe-shell/">Writing Safe Shell Scripts</a></h1>
<p>I've seen a couple of tips like these floating around, so I picked one.</p>
<p>Shell scripts are a hell of lifesaver, giving the initial states for a way to
automate stuff. But doing it right is a bit hard, and starting it in the safe
way can save your bacon in the long run -- or, at least, till you find a more
suitable tool.</p>
<h1 id="rust-dynamic-dispatching-deep-dive"><a href="https://medium.com/digitalfrontiers/rust-dynamic-dispatching-deep-dive-236a5896e49b">Rust Dynamic Dispatching deep-dive</a></h1>
<p>Dynamic Dispatching is a way to make Rust applications behave like you had
polymorphism: You attach a trait (interface) to a structure and call methods
using the trait instead.</p>
<p>I had trouble making it work recently and this explanation -- which is pretty
complete -- got me back in track.</p>
<h1 id="rust-web-development-tutorial-rest-api"><a href="https://cloudmaker.dev/how-to-create-a-rest-api-in-rust/">Rust Web Development Tutorial: REST API</a></h1>
<p>Actix is all in rage for development web applications in Rust: It basically
took almost <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">every position on web frameworks
benchmark</a> a few months ago and has
only consolidated its position -- not that the things it does are important
for CRUDs.</p>
<p>But the tutorial does the full job, explaining not only Actix, but also how to
plug Diesel, Rust famous ORM, into it.</p>

<p>Say goodbye to the problems of resolution! Do the hipster thing and instead of
using graphics, do everything in the console.</p>
<h1 id="an-open-source-collection-of-200-algorithmic-flash-cards-to-help-you-preparing-your-algorithm-data-structure-interview"><a href="https://github.com/teivah/algodeck">An Open-Source Collection of +200 Algorithmic Flash Cards to Help you Preparing your Algorithm &amp; Data Structure Interview</a></h1>
<p>While some people work on those &quot;Awesome X&quot;, some people actually builds cards
for you to learn about algorithms and related knowledge.</p>
<p>And it's all open source.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-give-a-great-presentation-timeless-advice-from-a-legendary-adman-1981"><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/12/20/writing-that-works-roman/">How to Give a Great Presentation: Timeless Advice from a Legendary Adman, 1981</a></h1>
<p>Working one a presentation? Thinking on doing some online presentation in
these days of &quot;stay at home&quot;?</p>
<p>On a personal note, I've been doing presentations for over two years already,
and most of the stuff I learnt in the field instead of some technical list.
But I see that small tips like these really do help, specially when you see
people actually paying attention (well, at least, when you're not doing this
online).</p>
<h1 id="writing-runbook-documentation-when-you-re-an-sre"><a href="https://www.transposit.com/blog/2020.01.30-writing-runbook-documentation-when-youre-an-sre/">Writing Runbook Documentation When You’re An SRE</a></h1>
<p>I worked with Runbooks once and I think they are awesome: &quot;If you find this
problem, do this&quot;.</p>
<p>The only &quot;but&quot; I could add to this is that it focused on SRE people, and I do
believe who should write those are the <em>developers</em>: they are the ones that
know why a save file operation failed.</p>
<p>Sadly, this is not quite true, 'cause developers tend to ignore errors, or use
some tool that doesn't provide a good view on where things can fail -- or,
worse, can fail without notifying the developer. In this case, the Runbook
should be built with the SRE <em>and</em> developers, so both can learn how the
application work and where it can fail.</p>
