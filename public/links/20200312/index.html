<p>A Netflix Tech post about the hexagonal architecture for microservices.</p>
<p>The interesting bit here is the fact that Netflix devs focused on &quot;swappable
data sources&quot;, which is something I've been pushing where I work a lot<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Even if I hate this posture a lot<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, now I can say &quot;Netflix does this, we
can do it too!&quot;</p>
<h1 id="do-not-log"><a href="https://sobolevn.me/2020/03/do-not-log">Do not log</a></h1>
<p>I really don't agree with this. I do understand that, sometimes, logging is
stupid and just adds noise, but we have see this problem in the same way we
see comments: They need to explain the <em>why</em>. <em>Why</em> the request failed? </p>
<p>Sometimes it can even be the <em>what</em>: <em>What</em> user input caused this process to
fail?</p>
<p>As the author argues, one could use Sentry for capturing failures, but what if
this isn't an option (due to cost)? I once worked with the free version of
Sentry and while it was okay, it didn't provide enough information to
understand the <em>why</em> things failed -- you can add the message in the
exception, but <em>only</em> if that's your code; what can you do if it is a library
causing the exception? Cascade everything?</p>
<p>Log. But think on <em>why</em> you're logging.</p>
<h1 id="eof-is-not-a-character"><a href="https://ruslanspivak.com/eofnotchar/">EOF is not a character</a></h1>
<p>My C life is build on top of lies!</p>
<p>Honestly, I thought EOF was really the same value as <code>^D</code> (Ctrl-D, which ends
the input) and you could put an EOF in the middle of the file and still have
content. But it seems it was not that.</p>

<p>Not too sure about the benchmarks used -- specially when someone says &quot;Svelte
was skipped due to cloc not being able to process .svelte files.&quot; when you can
surely use <code>wc</code>.</p>
<p>But still, interesting, in some aspects.</p>
<h1 id="actuallyusingwasm"><a href="https://wiki.alopex.li/ActuallyUsingWasm">ActuallyUsingWasm</a></h1>
<p>Implementations, runtimes, execution times, code samples... A bit of
everything about running Wasm.</p>
<h1 id="exploring-emacs-chart-library"><a href="https://francismurillo.github.io/2017-04-15-Exploring-Emacs-chart-Library/">Exploring emacs chart library</a></h1>
<p>No, I didn't drop VIM and start using Emacs, but it is really impressive that
it has a built in charts library -- which, on the other hand, just adds to the
&quot;Emacs is a good operating system, but lacks a good editor&quot; joke.</p>
<h1 id="my-exploration-of-rust-and-net"><a href="https://ericsink.com/entries/dotnet_rust.html">My exploration of Rust and .NET</a></h1>
<p>Converting LLVM bytecode from Rust to .NET assembly.</p>
<h1 id="init-struct-pattern"><a href="https://xaeroxe.github.io/init-struct-pattern/">Init Struct Pattern</a></h1>
<p>An initialization pattern for Rust structures. Honestly, I don't see that much
difference than using <code>Default</code> directly, but it may be interesting if you
should do some change in the input at construction.</p>
<p>(Also, I have the slight impression that the pattern, in the end, forces you
to build a complete object and then call <code>init()</code> to build a copy of said
already complete object.)</p>

<p>This is mostly interesting to me 'cause I'm part of the organization of two
conferences and we have this discussion about cancelling, postponing or going
forward for both.</p>

<p>A VIM plugin to jump to everywhere (except files, that is). But hell if it
isn't cute.</p>
