<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql"><a href="http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/">Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL</a></h1>
<p>A bunch of tips on how to manage nested/hierarchical information in MySQL.
While the storage format could be used in any database, it seems the insertion
part in the post is MySQL specific.</p>
<p>Curious, nonetheless.</p>
<h1 id="the-commons-clause-will-destroy-open-source"><a href="https://drewdevault.com/2018/08/22/Commons-clause-will-destroy-open-source.html">The Commons Clause will destroy open source</a></h1>
<p>While I don't agree with Drew in some points (mostly the things he rants
about), and while I don't think, on the surface, that the Commons Clause may
destroy open source, his words are a cautionary tale about picking the right
license<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h1 id="guide-to-starting-with-clojure"><a href="https://grison.me/2020/04/04/starting-with-clojure/">Guide to starting with Clojure</a></h1>
<p>It's been too long since I saw a very detailed introduction of a language like
this. Explaining installs, IDE/Editor configuration, a short description of
the language, a toy problem and a way to build and deploy the result.</p>
<p>Really complete -- and, on the plus side, it's Clojure!</p>
<h1 id="the-svelte-compiler-handbook"><a href="https://lihautan.com/the-svelte-compiler-handbook/">The Svelte Compiler Handbook</a></h1>
<p>While related to Svelte -- the JavaScript templating language -- what it
describes is pretty close to what every compiler do, in a high level, even if
some do more stuff, like Rust having two more steps before the code
generation, for optimization.</p>
<h1 id="language-design-stop-using-for-generics"><a href="https://soc.me/languages/stop-using-for-generics">Language Design: Stop Using &lt;&gt; for Generics</a></h1>
<p>Let's get into some controversy, shall we?</p>
<p>One the major points of Clojure is exactly how it pick one single pair for
each different aspect, contrary to Lisp, which used parenthesis for
everything.</p>
<p>So, what is being described here is to use <code>[]</code> instead of <code>&lt;&gt;</code> for generics.
But wouldn't that clash with array access? Sure, that's why array access
should be <code>()</code>. But wouldn't that clash with function calling? Sure, that's
why function calling should be... should be what again? Nothing? So we let it
clash?</p>
<p>&quot;<code>&lt;&gt;</code> is hard for compilers to parse&quot;. Oh, poor compiwer, it is weaving a bad
time? Newsflash, the job of a compiler <em>is</em> to take the hard work and leave
the simpler thing to users; the harder it does its work, the easier it is for
their users. If the users can clearly see generics with <code>&lt;&gt;</code> -- because it is
different from everything else -- then it is good.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup></p>
<h1 id="your-configs-suck-try-a-real-programming-language"><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/configs-suck.html">Your configs suck? Try a real programming language.</a></h1>
<p>Another controversy, just for fun.</p>
<p>Ok, so config formats are bad 'cause you can't replicate some stuff -- I can
agree with that, imagine having to copy and paste the same value over and
over?</p>
<p>But the problem is: Using a &quot;real programming language&quot; for configuration may
also have a problem: you need to cut a lot of stuff. Django uses Python itself
as a configuration -- and, again, I can agree with that, 'cause it allows one
to have a default configuration and just import it and override things for
your local execution -- but it doesn't block running anything. Worse, because
you can import things into the configuration file, one project that gets
compromised will <em>always</em> run the code.</p>
<p>Again, I agree with a lot of points, including the fact that the current
formats for configuration files are bad, but using a programming language for
it is not the solution. Besides, it is possible to overcome those problems
with better configuration settings themselves than the format; as hard as it
is.</p>

<h1 id="how-seo-ruined-the-internet"><a href="https://www.superhighway98.com/seo">How SEO Ruined the Internet</a></h1>
<p>Yes, everybody knows how the current trend of creating content focused on
producing better search results -- instead of, say, better quality content
that <em>should</em> be indexed due its quality -- basically made the internet a
terrible place.</p>
<p>This post describes some of the effects of this focus on the general internet
content.</p>

<p>This was weirdly timed with a presentation I finished talking about
licenses -- it's in Portuguese, and I haven't present it yet, but at some
point there will be a companion post for it, even in English.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Personally, using Scala as an example of &quot;doing right&quot; feels really
wrong. Scala does <em>a lot</em> wrong, I don't freaking care how much you like
Scala. Also, saying Python uses <code>[]</code> for generics is wrong 'cause Python
does <em>not</em> have generics.</p>
