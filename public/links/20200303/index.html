  <p>Interesting links for 2020-03-03.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/GoOpenBSDSituation">The situation with Go on
OpenBSD</a>:
I'm not interested in Go itself, but I've read similar things about Rust
on the *BSD. It's sad that such platform is a second class citizen for
newer, compiled languages.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2020/03/facebooks_downl.html">Facebook's Download-Your-Data Tool Is
Incomplete</a>:
Ok, first of all, delete your Facebook account (even if they still create
a &quot;dark profile&quot; of you). Second, with GDPR laws coming in full force
(like the California Privacy Law and the Brazilian version of GDPR, LGPD),
it's amazing to see that companies built on collecting everything about
you <em>still</em> fail to get in line.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.teserakt.io/2020/03/02/on-c-and-embedded-platforms/">On C and embedded
platforms</a>:
Although focused on embedded devices (which the post itself claims is a
lot larger and more limited than a Raspberry), it gives a long explanation
about the way C source is turned into an executable (and I may need some
points of this for a presentation called &quot;The Secret Life of the Linker&quot;).</li>
<li><a href="https://karenapp.io/articles/how-to-be-more-productive-less-effort/">42 Unique Productivity Tips: How to be more Productive with Less
Effort</a>:
Weirdly enough, I think I do half of those already, but I still don't
think I'm as productive as I should. Also, some points seem incomplete,
like the &quot;Biological Prime Time&quot;, which lacks information on <em>how</em> you
figure out your BPT. On the other hand, &quot;Create a Todon’t List&quot; is
something I never thought before!</li>
<li><a href="https://www.windows93.net/">Windows 93</a>: Have some time to play with
something stupid? Someone built a &quot;remixed&quot; version of Windows 95 with
HTML+CSS+JS.</li>
<li><a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2014/08/19/fork/">fork() can fail: this is
important</a>: Yes, <code>fork()</code>
can fail and you should check for failures; also yes, <code>malloc()</code> can fail
and you should check for failures. And this reminds me of Rust <code>Result</code>
(which you can also use in Haskell) and the fact that the compiler does
not let you get away from ignoring the errors. More languages should be
built like this.</li>
<li><a href="https://paulosman.me/2019/12/30/production-oriented-development.html">Production Oriented
Development</a>:
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> Ok, it's DevOps, but let's talk about this <em>again</em> for the people in
the back. The only point that I need to point that one should be careful
about is &quot;Buy Almost Always Beats Build&quot;: Sure, buying a done product is
better than a will-be product, but it may also force something akin to the
use of Design Patterns: changing the (real) problem to make it fit the
pattern or, in this case, changing the real problem to fit the tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://catonmat.net/vim-plugins">Vim plugins that I use</a>: A list of VIM
plugins. I have my fair share of plugins installed, but HOLY COW, that's
too much even for me.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>I think I shared this on Mastodon before, but I realized there is one
small point that needs some clarification.</p>
