<p>A bunch of &quot;things you need to remember when working on distributed systems&quot;,
not only for &quot;young bloods&quot;, but also for those who are doing this for
sometime, just as a reminder.</p>
<h2 id="writing-c-library-in-rust"><a href="https://www.ultrasaurus.com/2020/01/writing-c-library-in-rust/">writing c library in rust</a></h2>
<p>One of the cool things about Rust is that you can combine Rust applications
with any other C library. But not only that, it is also possible to write code
in Rust and export it as a C interface -- and, with that, combine with any
other language that can bind with C, which are basically every language around.</p>
<h2 id="self-protecting-projects"><a href="https://amihaiemil.com/2020/01/17/self-protecting-projects.html">Self-Protecting Projects</a></h2>
<p>Projects without a CI/CD pipeline are doomed to fail.</p>
<p>That's basically the gist of the post and I'm all for it too. There are a few
missing bits, like you can have a CI/CD pipeline and not having a policy for
writing tests; but, at the same time, I reckon there is no easy way to measure
if the proper things are being tested (and no, &quot;every single function&quot; is not
a measure).</p>
<p>Also, the idea of making the application open tickets every time the
application crashes is cool and all, but that only works for applications that
run on your own environment -- an embedded application would have a hard time
making this.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-keep-a-research-blog"><a href="http://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2020/01/12/why-research-blog/">Why I Keep a Research Blog</a></h2>
<p>I've been thinking about this for some time: I have a list of &quot;Things I Don't
Know&quot;, which I keep on <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>. The idea is that,
when I have some time, or when I see some information related to the topic, I
can add to the note, till I finally feel confident enough to say &quot;Ok, now I
understand this&quot;.</p>
<p>But for some time I've been writing this kind of post (the
&quot;<a href="https://blog.juliobiason.me/tags/links/">Links</a>&quot; ones) as a way to keep a
list of things that I feel I may need in the future. So, if I keep a list of
&quot;maybe in the future&quot; links, why don't I put the research topics also in this
blog? Surely, right now, it will have only the topics and no content (sorry!)
but making it available may also help someone else.</p>
<p>There is one point that one could make: If I share links, why not share links
related to those topics, and let the blog engine worry about grouping them?
The point is actually to write whatever I learnt in my own words, 'cause those
are easier to recall in the future.</p>
<p>I'm still wrangling with the idea, though. No promises.</p>
<h2 id="minnesota-is-now-using-contact-tracing-to-track-protestors-as-demonstrations-escalate"><a href="https://bgr.com/2020/05/30/minnesota-protest-contact-tracing-used-to-track-demonstrators/">Minnesota is now using contact tracing to track protestors, as demonstrations escalate</a></h2>
<p>You may recall that I've been, for a while, mentioning that contact tracing
applications may sound good to find someone that had contact with another
someone with COVID-19 (so we could alert and/or take that person to a
hospital, before it was too late for treatment), but there were serious
privacy problems with it? Well, there we go.</p>
<p>A black person was brutally killed by the police in the USA, and the community
rioted to the point that a police department was set afire -- I'm not saying
it was right or wrong, but you have to think the type of indignation that make
people set a <em>police department</em> on fire.</p>
<p>And those people who worried that they may get in contact with someone that
got infected with COVID-19 and installed any contact tracing application are
now being tracked by their association with other demonstrators.</p>
<p>And <em>that's</em> what I was talking about. There is no policy that says &quot;this
tracing information may be <em>only</em> used for diseases and nothing else&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="the-no-code-delusion"><a href="https://www.alexhudson.com/2020/01/13/the-no-code-delusion/">The 'No Code' Delusion</a></h2>
<p>Ignoring the fact that the post talks about a movement for &quot;creating
business rules without the need of a developer&quot;, what I found interesting is
the visual comparison of the business rule (in a diagram) and the code (a
piece of Python code). Why? Because that's exactly the way applications should
be written: There is logic and it is described in a combination of functions,
which content doesn't make part of the rule itself and there are no rules
&quot;hidden&quot; inside the function of a rule. There is nothing of &quot;let me put a
regexp here to validate the email&quot;. That's not what the business rule says, so
that's not in the code. If the business rule said &quot;You should test this,
convert to that and send this to there&quot;, that's exactly what the function
should have.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I didn't realized that diagrams require some previous
knowledge: Which symbol represents a test? Which symbol represents &quot;white in
the screen&quot;? And so on.</p>
<p>What I need to mention, though, is that COBOL was created for non-programmers
so they could describe business rules and run them; SQL was desgiedn so
non-programmers could describe how to retrieve and process data; BDD has
always been described as a way for non-programmers to describe how a system
should be validated.</p>
<h2 id="google-pushed-to-take-action-against-android-bloatware-by-50-organizations"><a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/01/11/android-bloatware-privacy-open-letter/#adnrb=900000">Google pushed to take action against Android bloatware by 50+ organizations</a></h2>
<p>A post from earlier this year, but there is one point that I need to bring:</p>
<p>Android is &quot;open source&quot;, right? If it is, why doesn't those 50+ organizations
just fork it and make their own Android? Surely, in a 50+ organization group,
there should be a few developers and making them all work on that could solve
the problem, right?</p>
<p>Well, thing is, Google controls Android. You can't simply fork and hope that
you can run on your device. You can't simply make a pull request and hope it
will, one day, be part of the system.</p>
<p>&quot;Android is opensource&quot; is a farce. It is &quot;source available&quot;, not &quot;open
source&quot; by any stretch of imagination.</p>
