            <a href="https://blog.juliobiason.me/tags/ui/">#ui</a>
        
  </span>
  <p>Two things in one: First of all, when using logging, use it to log events, not
for user interfaces; second, log <em>events</em> in a machine readable way, not
necessarily an human readable format.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>For a long time, I used logs to show to the user what was happening. To me, it
was logical to use something where I could mark errors as errors, general
information as information and, if the user requested more information, print
more information on what was going on. So I just added logging, defined normal
messages as <code>info</code>, errors as <code>errors</code>, information that may help me find
errors as <code>debug</code> and use <em>only</em> the logging system for all output of the
application.</p>
<p>But that's not what logs are targeted for -- and now I'm having to rethink
most of the stuff I already wrote.</p>
<p>Use the standard output to inform the user what's going on, in a human
readable format; use the standard error output to inform the user when things
go wrong; but use the logs to capture something that you'll have to process
later, so you should probably use a format that it is easier to parse, even if
it is not so friendly.</p>
<p>As an example, let's say you're connecting to a server. You could use the
standard output to say &quot;Connecting to server&quot;, to give the user a feedback
about what's going on; at the same time, you could log &quot;CONNECTION
[SERVER]&quot;, with the IP/Name of the server you're connecting. Surely, the
&quot;CONNECTION&quot; word is not that friendly to the user, but if you had to parse
the line, it would be really easy, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Another example: If your application is adding a record to the database, there
is nothing wrong logging &quot;ADDING_RECORD: field=value; field=value;
field=value&quot; 'cause, in case something goes wrong while saving the record, you
could have the values to try to figure out why it failed -- surely, logging
why it failed also helps, but you know what I mean. This is an example of
something that makes complete sense in logs, but not in user interfaces.</p>
