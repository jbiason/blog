  </span>
  <p>There is one magical thing you need to know when reading this book: It's all
personal opinion</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>A lot of stuff I'm going to discuss throughout this book will come directly
from my personal experience in several projects -- system applications, web
backend, embedded, mobile, stream processing -- in several different languages
-- C, C++, Python, Java, Clojure, Rust. And, because it comes from personal
experience, everything reflects my own personal opinion on several subjects.</p>
<p>Obviously, you don't need to agree with every single point. But I hope at
least it will make you rethink a few subjects.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes I may mention some examples that people who know me -- either
worked with me, heard me complain about some project, inherit one of my
projects, <em>I</em> inherit one of the <em>their</em> projects -- may recognized and think
I'm attacking the author.</p>
<p>I am not.</p>
<p>We do mistakes. Sometimes we don't know the topic with are attacking,
sometimes we don't have full specs, sometimes we don't have the time to write
things properly in a crunchtime. And that's why some things don't look as
pretty as they should. Heck, if you think I'm attacking the original author of
some example, look back the stuff I wrote and you'll see things a lot worse.</p>
<p>But I need the example. I have this hope that showing people a few mistakes
can make things better. I want to show people how my opinion built over
some subject. And, again, I'm in no way attacking the original author of the
code. I may even call the code &quot;stupid&quot;, but I'm not calling the author
<em>stupid</em>.</p>
<p>With that in mind...</p>
