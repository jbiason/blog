  <p>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two">The magical number</a>&quot; 
is a psychology article about the number of things one can keep in their mind
at the same time.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I've seen twice this weird construction on where a function would do some
processing, but its return value was the return of this processing, plus the
result of a second function and some bit of processing. Nothing major. But the
second function would also do some processing and call a third function. And
the third function would call a fourth. And the fourth a fifth. And the fifth,
a sixth function.</p>
<p>And the &quot;processing&quot; was not something small, like &quot;add two&quot; or &quot;multiply by
itself or a configurable value&quot;.</p>
<p>Something like this</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>func_1
</span><span> +-- func_2
</span><span>     +-- func_3
</span><span>	     +-- func_4
</span><span>		     +-- func_5
</span><span>			     +-- func6
</span></code></pre>
<p>(If you need the <em>real</em> processing I saw, it was a class that had a function
with some processing and then it would call a function in an injected
dependency -- which is pretty nice and dandy. But the injected dependency had
an injected dependency, and the third injected dependency <em>also</em> had an
injected dependency, and so forth).</p>
<p>Now, when you're trying to understand this kind of code to find a problem,
you'll have to keep in mind what the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and
sixth functions do, 'cause they are all calling each other (inside them).</p>
<p>This causes some serious mental overflow that shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p>Not only that, but imagine that you put a log before and after <code>func_1</code>: The
log before points the data that's being send to <code>func_1</code>, and the log after
its result.</p>
<p>So you'd end up with the impression that <code>func_1</code> does a lot of stuff, when it
actually is passing the transformation along.</p>
<p>(I got a weird experience with a function called <code>expand</code>, which logging
before the call would show some raw, compressed data, but the after was not
the expanded data, but actually a list of already processed data from the
compressed data.)</p>
<p>What would be a better solution, you may ask?</p>
<p>Well, if instead of making <code>func_1</code> call <code>func_2</code>, you can make it return the
result (which may not be the final result, anyway) and <em>then</em> call <code>func_2</code>
with that result.</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>result1 = func_1
</span><span>result2 = func_2(result1)
</span><span>result3 = func_3(result2)
</span><span>result4 = func_4(result3)
</span><span>result5 = func_5(result4)
</span><span>result6 = func_6(result5)
</span><span>result7 = func_7(result6)
</span></code></pre>
<p>(If we go back to the dependency injection chain, you may think that instead
of making DI7 receive DI6 as dependency [which would receive DI5 as
dependency, which would receive DI4 as dependency, which would receive DI3 as
dependency and so forth] you would actually create all the DI (dependency
injections) in one single pass and then the starting function would call the
dependencies in a single shot, not chaining them.)</p>
<p>Now you can see <em>exactly</em> how the data is being transformed -- and, obviously,
the functions would have better names, like <code>expand</code>, <code>break_lines</code>,
<code>name_fields</code> and so on, so you can see that that compressed data I mentioned
before is actually being decompressed, the content is being broke line by
line, the lines are getting names in its fields and so on (and one could even
claim that it would make things clear if there was a function after
<code>break_lines</code> which would just <code>break_fields</code>, which would make <code>name_fields</code>
more obvious -- and in a construction like this it would be almost trivial to
add this additional step).</p>
<p>&quot;But that isn't performant!&quot; someone may cry. Well, maybe it's just a bit less
performant than the original chained-calls ('cause it wouldn't create and
destroy frames in the stack, it would just pile them up and then &quot;unstack&quot; them
all in the end), but heck, optimization is for compilers, not people. Your job
is to make the code <em>readable</em> and <em>understandable</em>. If you need performance,
you can think of a better sequence of steps, not some &quot;let's make this a mess
to read&quot; solution.</p>
<p>Just a quick note: Although the famous paper mentions that the number is
around 7, new research is actually pointing that the number is way lower than
that, at 4. So simply making <code>func_1</code> call <code>func_2</code>, which would call
<code>func_3</code>, which would call <code>func_4</code> may be enough to overload someone and make
them lose the track of what the code does.</p>
