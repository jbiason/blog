  <p>&quot;Things I Learnt The Hard Way (In 30 Years of Software Development)&quot; started
as a simple sequence of toots (the same as &quot;tweets&quot;, on
<a href="https://functional.cafe/@juliobiason">Mastodon</a> when I was thinking about a
new presentation I could do.</p>
<p>But why &quot;a new presentation&quot;?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>I go around my state with a group called
&quot;<a href="https://tchelinux.org/">Tchelinux</a>&quot;: We usually go to universities and talk
to people starting uni, explaining things about free/libre software and
sometimes telling people about things they wouldn't normally see in the uni
curriculum.</p>
<p>One thing that annoys me is that there are very few presentations about &quot;when
things go wrong&quot;. All the presentations show prototypes or tell the good
stuff, and hide all the wrong things that could happen<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. Obviously, after
working 30 years in the field of software development, I saw my fair share of
things going wrong -- sometimes in unimaginable piles of crap -- and I thought
&quot;maybe that's something people would like to hear&quot;.</p>
<p>(And, to be completely honest, some of those piles of crap were my own fault.)</p>
<p>And that's when the toot sequence started. Just before I noticed, I spent the
whole day just posting this kind of stuff (fortunately, my pile of things in
the &quot;incoming&quot; folder was a bit empty at the time) and it had 30 points, plus
addenda and a few explanation points. That's when I decided to group all
them in a single post.</p>
<p>(Actually, I'm lying: Someone mentioned on Functional Café that I should make
a blog post for making it easier to read.)</p>
<p>All I thought when I grouped everything in a post was &quot;this will make things
easier for the people following the thread on Mastodon&quot;. But then the post
appeared on Reddit. And Twitter. And HackerNews. And YCombinator. And none of
those where mine.</p>
<p>But here is the thing: Each point was limited by the toot size, which is 500
characters. Sometimes that's not enough to expand the point, explain it
properly and add some examples.</p>
<p>And that's how the idea to write this &quot;book&quot; came to life.</p>
<p>One thing you must keep in mind here: <em>These are my options</em>. I understand
that not everything is so black and white as put here, and some people's
experiences may not match things here. Also, you get a bit cynical about
technology after 30 years. So... thread carefully, 'cause here be dragons.</p>

<p>Yup, I'm guilty of that too.</p>
