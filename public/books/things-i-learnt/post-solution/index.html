  <p>You may think &quot;This project is so small and so focused on whatever I needed, I
should never post it on Github. What would people think?&quot; Github is not for
that.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Github is not a repository for &quot;cool, almost perfect&quot; projects. You're free to
show that, at some point, you were a beginner<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can always come back, review what you did and fix it. It will, as your
<a href="/books/things-i-learnt/blogging">blog</a>, show that you're improving.</p>
<p>... or maybe you'll let your project there just to rot. I still have some
Python projects that I wrote when I was learning the language that, although
they work, they don't look like Python projects.</p>
<p>But who knows? Maybe the code you wrote to solve your small problem can help
someone else to fix their problem, which was not exactly the same, but pretty
close. Or even you could get a code review that would teach you something new
about the language/design you used.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Whoever see the first projects I did in
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> wouldn't think I have 30 years of
experience in the field. Everybody is a beginner at some point.</p>
