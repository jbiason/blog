  <p>As I was discussing about <a href="https://blog.juliobiason.me/code/microservices-artifact-input-state/">artifacts in
microservices</a>, I guess I forgot to
discuss some important point: How those artifacts are &quot;ejected&quot; from the
microservice?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>&quot;Ejected&quot;, in this case, means &quot;pass it to the next necessary stage&quot;, which
can mean a lot of stuff (sometimes, more than one). Also, I needed some catchy
word for it 'cause simply &quot;produces&quot; isn't that fashionable.</p>
<p>For example, if your microservice is producing intermediate data -- say, it
connects to an external service and retrieves information, which is then
processed by different microservices -- then you probably want to use a
message broker as the ejection route for the artifact. Using a message broker
will allow another services to keep listening to the creation of those
artifacts and do their thing -- producing new artifacts.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that this microservice is the end of the production
line and, thus, it just keeps the artifact in order to by consumed in a
non-asynchronous way. For example, the microservice may produce elements that
are later requested by a web request, so what its needs is to produce said
artifact and keep it around, responding requests later.</p>
<p>This, again, is akin to the way CQRS (command-query response segregation)
works: You have one side of your microservice receiving data and processing
its artifact, and another that allows querying the artifacts.</p>
<p>You can even do both: When the artifact is produced, the microservice ejects
it through a message broker to be processed by other microservices and still
stores it internally to be queried. </p>
<p>There is even the possibility of the query part be just another microservice:
It gets the artifact from another microservice and stores it, with no
processing (if you don't count as &quot;saves in a permanent storage&quot; a
processing). This is interesting 'cause the &quot;query&quot; part of the microservice
is just another microservice, instead of being some sort of specialized
microservice that produces, ejects and stores artifacts.</p>
<p>When I mentioned we saved our artifacts in Firebase, we are basically building
this split microservice: While we have microservices that produce the
artifacts, the &quot;storage and query&quot; part is giving to Firebase -- but you can
consider this as any other service.</p>
<p>(This whole post is just to give some pointers on what I want to discuss next,
which are some thoughts about self-healing microservices -- and what I meant
by that.)</p>
