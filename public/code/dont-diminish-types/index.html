  <p>In a previous life, I had a long discussion on why adding booleans was a bad
idea. And just recently one of the core Python developers suggested the same
thing -- adding booleans, that is. This is a long rant on why such things are
bad.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Once at some previous job, I blocked a code review in which the other developer
did something like </p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#b48ead;">if </span><span>boolean1 + boolean2:
</span><span>	</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">do_thing</span><span>()
</span></code></pre>
<p>Why this was bad, in my view? 'Cause it was reducing the booleans into simple
integers. While it is true that booleans are, internally, in Python, integers,
what they <em>represent</em> is not integers, but actually true or false. People got
it -- or, at least, they say they got it, but the code changed, anyway -- and
live moved on.</p>
<p>But, last month, I had to see Raymond Hettinger, one of the core Python
developers, post 
<a href="https://twitter.com/raymondh/status/1123950707273551878">this on twitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>#python tip:  The boolean values False and True are equal to zero and one.</p>
<p>Replace:
sum(1 for x in data if pred(x))</p>
<p>with:
sum(pred(x))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviosly, what he meant was to use</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#96b5b4;">sum</span><span>(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">pred</span><span>(x) </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">for </span><span>x </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">in </span><span>my_list)
</span></code></pre>
<p>... instead of</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#96b5b4;">sum</span><span>(</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1 </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">if </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">pref</span><span>(x) </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">else </span><span style="color:#d08770;">0 </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">for </span><span>x </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">in </span><span>my_list)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Again, basing on the fact that Python uses integers behind the scenes to deal
with booleans.</p>
<p>And, as you can guess, that really annoyed me.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-types">What Are Types</h2>
<p>Let me explain, in a long rant, why &quot;booleans are integers&quot; is bad.</p>
<p>Imagine the computer memory. Imagine one specific memory location, being used,
with this value:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>65</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does it mean? That's where languages and their types come in.</p>
<p>For example, let's imagine that this location is being managed by a C program
and the program and this program marked this value as a <code>char</code>. While <code>char</code>s
in C represent 8 bit integers<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, they have being for a long time used to
represent one character in a string -- a sequence of <code>char</code>s actually
represents a string<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#2">2</a></sup>. So, when other developers see <code>char</code>, they think &quot;Ok,
this is the character with code 65&quot; (which is &quot;A&quot;, by the way).</p>
<p>If the same code use <code>int</code>, other developers would think &quot;Yeah, this is the
<em>number</em> 65&quot;.</p>
<p>And, just to screw things up, it could be an <code>enum</code>, in which the value
represents the 65th variant (element) of that enum.</p>
<p>And that's the reason types exist: -- instead of, say, developers managing
memory directly and just changing their representation, like in Assembly --
they provide consistent representation over the internal storage.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-adding-booleans">The Problem With Adding Booleans</h2>
<p>So, we saw that memory is just a bunch of bytes and what gives meaning for
those bytes -- in programming languages, that is -- are types<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Now let's see another developer seeing the code above; they go from the top of
the code to the bottom, and reach the line of <code>sum(pred(x) for x in my_list</code>.
The first thought they come is that <code>sum</code> acts on numbers, so obviously <code>pred</code>
is a function that return numbers. But what number it represents? So they go
check <code>pref</code> and see it returning <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. Now they have to trace
back and rethink what the line did, leaving them with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive
dissonance</a>, which is a
clever way of saying &quot;they have to rethink what they already though&quot;.</p>
<p>And too many situations with cognitive dissonance is what makes code
&quot;unreadable&quot; -- the line above is still readable, but it doesn't actually
represent what it shows.</p>
<h2 id="respect-your-types">Respect Your Types</h2>
<p>Python is very loose with its type system<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#4">4</a></sup>, but it doesn't mean one could
play &quot;fast and furious&quot; over it. Let's say that, at some point, Python
developers decide to change <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> from their integer roots to be
actually symbols -- things that simply &quot;exist&quot; and have no value<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#5">5</a></sup><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#6">6</a></sup>. Then
everyone that managed booleans as integers would see their code misbehaving or
crashing, simply because they didn't thread booleans <em>as booleans</em>.</p>
<p>Now let's see the other option: <code>sum(1 if pred(x) else 0 for x in my_list)</code>.
This line is (a) longer and (b) slower due the branching during execution (the
<code>if</code>). But when you read something like this you see that there is a function
where its value isn't being checked, which probably means it returns a
boolean<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#7">7</a></sup>; if it is true, returns 1; if it is false, returns 0; and you're
actually doing a sum of ones and zeroes -- as numbers.</p>
<p>No cognitive dissonance, no messing around and just because we treated types
as types.</p>
<p>PS: After a small discussion about what's better, I came with a better line
than the <code>1 if pred(x) else 0</code>:</p>
<pre data-lang="python" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#96b5b4;">sum</span><span>(</span><span style="color:#d08770;">1 </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">for </span><span>x </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">in </span><span>my_list </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">if </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">pred</span><span>(x))
</span></code></pre>
<p>Why this would be better? Because, when you think what you actually want --
count the number of <code>True</code>s in the list -- you can actually use a feature in
list comprehensions for filtering: the <code>if</code> at the end. This will count 1 (a
number) only if the element being processed &quot;agrees&quot; with the predicate.</p>
<p>That line could be translated like something as</p>
<pre data-lang="java" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-java "><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span>myList.</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">stream</span><span>()
</span><span>	.</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">filter</span><span>(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">x </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt; </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">pred</span><span>(x))
</span><span>	.</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">map</span><span>(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">x </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">-&gt; </span><span style="color:#d08770;">1</span><span>)
</span><span>	.</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">sum</span><span>();
</span></code></pre>
<p>... in Java 8: You remove the non-True values of the list, convert the <code>True</code>s
to 1 (a number) and sum the total.</p>
<hr />
<p>Footnotes:</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="1"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>They could use more than 8 bits, depending on the architecture, and due
the fact that the C Standard is very flexible in this concept</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="2"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>It doesn't mean that every single <code>char</code> is a character in a string, it
could be used exactly as an 8 bit integer</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="3"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p>I'm being very lose here about types, there is a lot more complex
context in them, but I'm going to stick with this &quot;representation&quot; for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="4"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">4</sup>
<p>Maybe nose as loose as C, which lets you &quot;convert&quot; a memory that
represents a float into a integer with no sign.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="5"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">5</sup>
<p>Or, better yet, that can have <em>any</em> value and would still work.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="6"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">6</sup>
<p>As far as I know, Python standard already forced booleans to be
integers, so that will never happen, but let's add this for the sake of
discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="7"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">7</sup>
<p>This is one of times I feel jealous of Clojurist, which can use <code>?</code> in
their functions and actually have a coding style that says that predicates
-- functions that either return True or False -- end with <code>?</code>; so not only
someone reading a piece of Clojure code seeing a <code>is_valid?</code> knows it
returns a boolean, it actually <em>reads</em> like a boolean check.</p>
