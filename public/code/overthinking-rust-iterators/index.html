  <p>I had some issue recently with Rust iterators, and that led me to think <em>a lot</em>
about iterators in Rust.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>What I wanted to do was something not exactly direct in Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>The issue was an external REST API;</li>
<li>The API returns the data in chunks, providing a paging mechanism;</li>
<li>The API indicates that there are more data with a <code>next</code> field, which either
has the URL for the next page or an empty string if you're in the last page
and there is no more data;</li>
<li>On my side, I wanted something akin to (which is basically an iterator,
anyway)</li>
</ul>
<pre data-lang="rust" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-rust "><code class="language-rust" data-lang="rust"><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> service = Service(connection_information);
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">let</span><span> data = service.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">data</span><span>();  </span><span style="color:#65737e;">// This provides the iterator
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">while let </span><span>Some(record) = data.</span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">next</span><span>() {
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">do_something</span><span>(&amp;record);
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The <code>.data()</code> iterator would get the first page and start iterating over
those results;</li>
<li>Once the results were all consumed, if the API informed that there is more
data, the iterator (or <em>something</em>) would request more information, adjust
itself for the new data and just keep chugging till all the data was
produced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that the iterator I want have two sides: One is to spew information from
previous request from memory/cache; the second is requesting (or triggering the
request somewhere) for more data.</p>
<h1 id="back-to-iterators">Back to Iterators</h1>
<p>Basic iterators work like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.juliobiason.me/code/overthinking-rust-iterators/normal-iterator.png" alt="" title="A basic view of an iterator" /></p>
<p>... which you have a dataset, create an iterator over them and each call of
<code>.next()</code> on it will advance the iterator over the next element of the data and
return a reference to that data; once it reaches the end of data, it returns a
<code>None</code>, indicating that there are no more data.</p>
<p>The fun thing about iterators is that they need to hold their own state: Which
is the current element that I'm pointing to? The <code>.next()</code> receives a mutable
reference of self exactly due this: It changes its state on each call of
<code>.next()</code>.</p>
<p>What I need is, basically, an iterator that does that <strong>and</strong>, once it sees
<code>None</code>, retrieves more data and starts over. This raises the question: How does
the iterator gets more data?</p>
<h1 id="the-fat-iterator-approach">The Fat Iterator Approach</h1>
<p>The idea I had was to create a fat iterator that would &quot;hold&quot; its own data and
iterate over it.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.juliobiason.me/code/overthinking-rust-iterators/fat-iterator.png" alt="" title="A fat iterator which has its own data" /></p>
<p>Because the data is simply a <code>Vec&lt;&gt;</code>, I could do something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull data from service;</li>
<li>Update the <code>data</code> inside the iterator;</li>
<li>Create a new iterator over said <code>data</code>;</li>
<li>Call <code>.next()</code> on the iterator till it turns into <code>None</code>;</li>
<li>If there is more data, do the request and jump to 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we jump back to the fact that <code>.next()</code> updates the iterator internal state,
this means that I'd need to keep the data <strong>and</strong> its iterator in the same
structure. And that causes issues with the borrow checker, 'cause I can't own
part of the data when I own the whole data (yes, it feels like a problem with
the borrow check, but still).</p>
<p>The idea seems solid, except I'd be fighting the borrow checker to a point I'm
not capable yet.</p>
<h1 id="the-request-someone-else-iterator">The &quot;Request Someone Else&quot; Iterator</h1>
<p>The other idea I had (but couldn't figure out how it would work) was to,
instead of <code>service.data()</code> return an iterator, it would return the data holder
and <em>that</em> could create an iterator over itself. The weird thing about this is
that the iterator would have to have a mutable reference to the source data, so
it could call the parent when it reached the end of the data, and the parent
would get a new data source and the iterator would &quot;reset itself&quot; after calling
it -- which sounds more complex than it should.</p>
<p>(I could also make the parent holder have a <code>Cell&lt;&gt;</code> over data to have just
internal mutability over it, but again, sounds more complex than it should).</p>
<h1 id="the-solution">The Solution</h1>
<p>Sorry, no solution (yet). I'm still tinkering with it and I'll update this
once I find something that works and it doesn't require two (or more) things
(mutably) interacting between themselves.</p>
