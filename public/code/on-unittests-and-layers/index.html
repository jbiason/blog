  </span>
  <p>On a recent discussion about testing, I think I came up with a
reason why some people really think we need to test everything: they
are thinking in layers, without even realizing it.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>This weekend I had an idea on why some people insist on writing tests for
every single function and object, but first you must know that 3 things
happened:</p>
<p>First, I told someone a programmer-joke like this: &quot;You can't teach top-down
development to newcomers 'cause they don't know which side is up.&quot; (Actually, I
heard from someone else; I'm not that smart to come with a line like this).
Yes, it is a joke; yes, it is somewhat fun, but at the same time, it is a
reality: we should let newcomers get wet before telling them how to properly
design their project.</p>
<p>The second is that I got &quot;drafted&quot; to do a tutorial on DjangoRestFramework and,
because I was expecting someone to ask how to manage validation on forms and
serializers and decided to learn a bit more about &quot;fat models&quot;, which basically
says you should put all your business rules on the model layer. And here is the
part that stuck with me: the model is not an <em>object</em>, but a <em>layer</em>.</p>
<div style="border:1px solid grey; margin:7px; padding: 7px">
	<p>&quot;forms&quot; are responsible for validating incoming HTML form content;
&quot;serializers&quot; are responsible for validating incoming data from the API --
although &quot;serializers&quot; are also responsible for serializing the output data
back to the client.</p>

</div>
<p>The third is that I was summoned to explain to a group to explain what should
be tested. Thing is, they did a &quot;fizzbuzz&quot; code in which they had
<code>multiple_of_3</code>, <code>multiple_of_5</code>, <code>multiple_of_15</code> and someone mentioned
that we <em>should</em> test them too.</p>
<p>And that's what got me thinking: Should we test it? My response for this
question is always &quot;no, think your project is a black box in which you press a
button and some light goes on; you don't need to know if there is a nerve
somewhere in your knee that you hit it and your leg does some kicking or if
the signal is sent all the way to your brain and it sends a response back to
the muscle to make it kick, all you need to know -- and test -- is that when
you hit someone in the knee, they kick and <em>that's</em> your requirement and
<em>that's</em> what you should test.&quot; But what if it is not that simple?</p>
<p>The model <em>layer</em> has a responsability and has its own requirements: It should
receive the data and store it somewhere; it can expose some business rules (as
validation of said data) but shouldn't run those rules. The controller <em>layer</em>
also has its own responsabilities and its own requireements: it gets the data
from somewhere, do the checks, validate the business rules and then sends it
to the model layer to be store. The view <em>layer</em>, again, has its own
responsabilities and its own requirements: exposes the data to the user and
receives data from the user and passes it to the controller layer, exposing
the errors back to the user.</p>
<p>In a way, all those layers could be separate projects: because they have a
defined API, one could replace each layer independently -- I could have a
model layer that stores all that in JSON and then replace it to one that
stores in a Stream Processing Database and the controller and view layers will
never know about. All those layers could be separate <em>libraries</em> -- a lost art
of getting code with a single functionality and giving it its own space, with
its own build tools and a well defined interface and which is its used by other
projects as a black box: they know the interface, but they don't know how,
internally, the library does whatever it does.</p>
<p>And, because each library has its own code, it will have its own tests.</p>
<p>And that's what people were seeing: They were seeing, unconciously,  &quot;this is
another <em>layer</em> in the project, this layer should be tested because it can be
replaced any time&quot;. Each <code>multilple_of</code> function was an <em>API</em> exposed from
the model layer and, thus, should be tested. Even if the design doesn't seem
to be layered and appear all around the code.</p>
<p>Thing is, each layer is nothing by itself: There is no use for exposing
business/validation rules without a controller to send the data; there is no
use for something to validate incoming data and apply business rules if there
is noone sending the data and noone to store it; there is no use for something
responsibile for calling business rules check if there isn't business rules.
All three layers are required to do the word -- and that's probably why I
believe you should test them all as a single unity.</p>
<p>But, in the very end, it seems that going full force into unit tests and what
should be tested can actually help people see they layers of their projects.</p>
