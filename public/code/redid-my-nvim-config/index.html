  <p>For some obscure reason, my NeoVim install decided it didn't want to
display LSP warnings anymore. So I redid the whole configuration.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Believe me, I didn't do 'cause &quot;OMG, so broken&quot;. I guess I could have tracked
the problem to the way
<a href="https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim">LanguageClient</a> was
installed -- it could be even out-of-date, 'cause I updated to NeoVim 0.6
recently -- but I also wanted to install the TreeSitter support, for better
highlight. Those two factors were enough to me to try a different
configuration, so I decided to do the full thing and rewrite the whole
configuration file, using the Lua format.</p>
<p>I started with the <a href="https://blog.inkdrop.app/how-to-set-up-neovim-0-5-modern-plugins-lsp-treesitter-etc-542c3d9c9887">post of Takuya
Matsuyama</a>,
just as reference -- I'm not a user of a package manager (and
there may lie the problem with some outdated plugin) and I really prefer to
work with submodules and whatnot -- a way that is pretty close to what
<a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a> does.</p>
<p>As I wanted to move some things from my old configuration to the new, I had to
search on how to &quot;translate&quot; those. That's where I found <a href="https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/configuring-neovim-using-lua/">a post by Heiker
Curiel</a>,
which lists old configuration options and how they appear in the Lua config.</p>
<p>The result is that I have a brand sparkling NeoVim install, with all the bells
and wristles:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.juliobiason.me/code/redid-my-nvim-config/vim6.png" alt="" title="Yes, I do like to write long documentation strings" /></p>
<p>The whole configuration file is <a href="https://git.juliobiason.me/dotfiles.git/tree/nvim">in my personal Git
repo</a>.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-left-out">What was left out?</h3>
<p>When migrating, I few things I did not add in this new configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fuzzy find: Previously I was using <a href="https://github.com/lotabout/skim">Skim</a>
for opening files with fuzzy find (e.g., type a few letters, see a list of
the files with those letters). The Vim plugin for it was a bit flaky
(sometimes it would completely ignore the typed input, which I think it meant
it crashed somehow). But, 'cause I used only when bored, I decided that I
won't use a fuzzy find; my favourite way of finding files is using the <code>-</code>
shortcut, which I set to open <code>:Ex</code>.</li>
<li>Snippets: <a href="https://github.com/sirver/UltiSnips">UltiSnips</a> was not working
before, so I decided not to try it again. I'll probably look at some other
option in the future.</li>
<li>Per FileType configuration: Previously I had a bunch of autocommands to set
specific configuration for each file type (e.g., Python files should always
use spaces instead of tabs, but HTML should use tabs instead of spaces). I
left it out mostly 'cause there is no Lua support for such commands yet, as
far as I know (you can run VimScript commands still, but I'm being a bit
retentive about mixing those).</li>
<li>Auto-trim lines: My previous configuration used an autocommand for running a
regular expression that would remove all tailing spaces in the lines. Because
I use Rust mostly these days and the LSP configuration can run the
autoformatter (<code>rustfmt</code>, in this case) and this already remove tailing
spaces, I decided to leave this option out for now.</li>
</ul>
