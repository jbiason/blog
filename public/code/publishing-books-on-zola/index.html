            <a href="https://blog.juliobiason.me/tags/zola/">#zola</a>
        
  </span>
  <p>A long time ago I wrote a couple of posts on a WordPress, then moved them to
GitBook. Unfortunately, GitBook changed its layout to something a bit more
confusing and now I'm bringing them back to this blog, which runs Zola.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Zola is a blog system; a static blog generator. It wasn't projected to be a
publishing tool, but because it has support for publishing stuff without
appearing in the main page, specialized templates for each page and
shortcodes, I managed to come with a clever solution.</p>
<p>But let's see how I did:</p>
<h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2>
<p>The first problem is tied to the current Zola themes: some of them lack
support for tags, some for sections and some to both. For <a href="https://github.com/getzola/after-dark/">After
Dark</a>, I
had to add support for both, but renamed it to
<a href="https://github.com/jbiason/nighttime">Nighttime</a>. This allows
putting the books in their own sections, which helps the general organization
of the content.</p>
<h2 id="hiding-book-posts-from-main-site">Hiding Book Posts From Main Site</h2>
<p>Each Zola section needs a <code>_index.md</code> file with the meta information for the
section; for example, it's title.</p>
<p>To make posts in a section not appear in the main site (you know, the site
index), you need to set a property in its meta information: <code>transparent</code>.
When a section is transparent, posts inside the section will not appear in the
main index and, thus, will be contained only on the section.</p>
<p>... unless you want to make some &quot;episodic&quot; chapters and allow them to appear
in the main site. That's up for you.</p>
<h2 id="post-order-in-the-section">Post Order in the Section</h2>
<p>By default, posts in sections are ordered from the most recent to the oldest,
based on their published date. You can change this by changing the <code>sort_by</code>
property in the section to <code>weight</code>, which will show posts by weight, from the
lightest to the heaviest.</p>
<p>Why would you want to change the order of posts in the section? 'Cause the
section content works pretty damn fine as a general index for your book, which
each post as a chapter.</p>
<p>All fine and dandy, but the fact is that posts titles, with their dates and
summaries, is not a very good index. But Zola has a workaround for this: Each
section data can also have a <code>template</code> option, which allows using a different
template for that section alone. In my case, I created a template on
&quot;Nighttime&quot; that have all the meta information but not the posts in it, called
<code>section-contentless.html</code>. </p>
<p>But what is good about a section/book with a title and an empty index? That's
another thing Zola can do: If you add any content in the <code>_index.md</code>, it will
be rendered normally. So you can write the index yourself (which is not
optimal, but it works).</p>
<p>As a side note, you can also create a template which shows only the post
title, no summary or date, and use the weight solution.</p>
<h2 id="navigation">Navigation</h2>
<p>Although you can now display the book with its chapters, it still is a bit
hard for readers to do a nice, continuous reading if they need to go back to
the index after reading a chapter to get to the next.</p>
<p>For that, you can use a shortcode to add the navigation at the bottom of each
post. Something like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="jinja" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-jinja "><code class="language-jinja" data-lang="jinja"><span>&lt;div&gt;
</span><span>	{% </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">if </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">prev_chapter_link </span><span>%}
</span><span>		&lt;div style=&quot;float:left&quot;&gt;
</span><span>			&amp;lt;&amp;lt; &lt;a href=&quot;{{ </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">prev_chapter_link </span><span>}}&quot;&gt;{{ </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">prev_chapter_title </span><span>}}&lt;/a&gt;
</span><span>		&lt;/div&gt;
</span><span>	{% </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">endif </span><span>%}
</span><span>
</span><span>	&amp;nbsp;
</span><span>
</span><span>	{% </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">if </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">next_chapter_link </span><span>%}
</span><span>		&lt;div style=&quot;float:right&quot;&gt;
</span><span>			&lt;a href=&quot;{{ </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">next_chapter_link </span><span>}}&quot;&gt;{{ </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">next_chapter_title </span><span>}}&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;
</span><span>		&lt;/div&gt;
</span><span>	{% </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">endif </span><span>%}
</span><span>&lt;/div&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>And then, adding in the end of each post a 
<code>{ { nav(prev_chapter_link=&quot;&lt;link&gt;&quot;, prev_chapter_title=&quot;Title&quot;, next_chapter_link=&quot;&lt;link&gt;&quot;, next_chapter_title=&quot;Title&quot;) }}</code> 
and Zola will add the HTML (with the parameters) at the bottom of each post,
making navigation easier.</p>
<p>And that's basically it!</p>
