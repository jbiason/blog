  <p>Random thought about the previous post about &quot;Things I Learnt The Hard Way&quot;.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>When I wrote the post about &quot;Things I Learnt The Hard Way&quot;, I never thought it
would gather the traction it did.</p>
<p>It was posted <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bzipb5/things_i_learnt_the_hard_way_in_30_years_of/">on Reddit</a>,
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/hf0bkk/things_i_learnt_hard_way_30_years_software">on Lobste.rs</a>,
and it is being discussed on Twitter.</p>
<p>None of those was posted by me (except a single tweet, which didn't gather
that much attention).</p>
<p>Since then, I've added a bunch of new points -- as life goes on, I remember
another thing that I forgot to mention in the first time -- and when I write
this new post, the original now captures 83 (!!!) points.</p>
<p>But while the short format gives a quick idea of what I meant, it doesn't
properly explain the points -- and a lot of people are (correctly) raising
those in the discussion boards. So I feel I should really expand those.</p>
<p>And, at the same time, I have created a few macros for
<a href="http://getzola.org/">Zola</a> (the blogging engine I'm using) to &quot;publish&quot; some
books (if you allow me to be really loose with the meaning of &quot;publishing&quot;).</p>
<p>That's why I'm currently considering expanding the points in a digital book
format, also here in this blog, using each point as a chapter.</p>
<p>I'll still update the original post, but expanding the points into chapters
will give me more room to put my thoughts on each of them, and I can link each
point to the longer explanation.</p>
<p>Sounds like a plan, doesn't it?</p>
