  <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2935510/">IMDB Summary</a>:
Astronaut Roy McBride undertakes a mission across an unforgiving solar system
to uncover the truth about his missing father and his doomed expedition that
now, 30 years later, threatens the universe.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><div>
	★★☆☆☆
</div>
<p>I remember some friends saying that &quot;The movie looks like sci-fi, but it
isn't&quot;, but I have to say, it <em>is</em> sci-fi. It's not classic sci-fi, in which
they use some futuristic/scientific-based upgrades to explore some other topics
-- Star Trek is a classic in doing this. But this movie does a whole <em>metaphor</em>
using sci-fi.</p>
<p>One of the curious aspects is that they managed to make old actors look like
old people. Tommy Lee looks old. Donald Sutherland looks old. Even Brad Pitt
looks somewhat older than me (well, <em>almost</em> older than me). Gone are the days
of 51-year-old Tom Cruise looked like 30-something in &quot;Oblivion&quot;. No, Brad Pitt
character looks 40-almost-50, Tommy Lee looks like the father or someone
40-almost-50 and Donald Sutherland looks like the colleague of that father. It
is a nice change, though.</p>
<p>The visuals are impressive, almost &quot;Gravity&quot; quality. The space elevator/power
generator looks like a real thing. I almost got pissed in that intro 'cause it
seemed they forgot something, but then things happen and I wasn't that pissed
anymore.</p>
<p>The movie pacing is weird. There are not speed ups and no speed downs, but the
whole thing moves like a crawl, to the point of boredom. I could watch
something on my phone during the movie (I watched at home, not in the cinema,
don't worry) and I didn't lose anything, in the end.</p>
<p>And, speaking of the end, that's when the whole metaphor downs to you. But
then, you're tired of the crawling pacing and it feels really &quot;meh&quot;.</p>
<p>I may watch again for the visuals, but would probably switch channels in some
less visually appealing scene and get lost in some other movie.</p>
