<p>It's kinda weird to read a book that your experience agrees with what it is
said: I have a collection of things I learnt in 30 years doing software
development, and a lot of things said in the book agree with it.</p>
<p>Now, because there are several authors, the writing style changes a lot: Some
are really dense and difficult to follow, some others are simple and fun to
read, and some feel really repetitive.</p>
<p>One of the downsides of the book is that they should get a more diverse group.
Sure, Uncle Bob is highly influential and has a lot of good tips, but giving
him 3 articles, when there are only 6 women and 2 black men in the list of
authors seems kinda a waste<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Sure, for people starting in the development world, it's a good book, giving
some pointers on where to start, but for people who are in the area for some
time (and may already read some books/posts about the topics), it may feel a
bit like a waste of time.</p>
<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Repetition in Process Calls for Automation </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Repetition in Logic Calls for Abstraction </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>learn much faster by writing test code </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>ANYONE WHO HAS WORKED IN SOFTWARE LONG ENOUGH has heard questions like this:
I’m getting exception XYZ. Do you know what the problem is? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: I get that <em>a lot</em>!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you work on a project, you will understand more of the problem domain
and, hopefully, find more effective ways of reaching the goal </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Hint: Write code because it adds value, not because it amuses you.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: Well, and what actually &quot;adds value&quot;? Does refactoring something adds
value, if the only thing it does is making it easier for <em>me</em> to understand?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That isn’t YAGNI. If you don’t need it right now, don’t write it right now.) </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary purpose of software estimation is not to predict a project’s
outcome; it is to determine whether a project’s targets are realistic enough
to allow the project to be controlled to meet them </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to learn from other people’s mistakes, so that your code won’t contain
the same ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: Work on new mistakes :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IN ALL BUT THE SMALLEST DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, people work with people.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Compared to “hard” engineering, the software development world is at about
the same place the bridge builders were when the common strategy was to
build a bridge and then roll something heavy over it. If it stayed up, it
was a good bridge. If not, well, time to go back to the drawing board </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A bridge builder would never hear from his boss, “Don’t bother doing
structural analysis on that building—we have a tight deadline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I'm not saying that Uncle Bob isn't worth getting 3 spots, so maybe
the list should have more than 97 points to let others also have a spot.</p>
