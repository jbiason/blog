  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68020.Powers">GoodReads Summary</a>:
Young Gav can remember the page of a book after seeing it once, and,
inexplicably, he sometimes &quot;remembers&quot; things that are going to happen in the
future. As a loyal slave, he must keep these powers secret, but when a
terrible tragedy occurs, Gav, blinded by grief, flees the only world he has
ever known. </p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><div>
	★★★★★
</div>
<p>&quot;The story of a boy becoming a man.&quot; </p>
<p>Or &quot;The story of a slave becoming a freeman.&quot;</p>
<p>Or &quot;The story of a man traveling across its country.&quot;</p>
<p>All those could serve as a quick description of the story. And all of them
would be, at least, a bit wrong.</p>
<p>Because it's not just one of those. It's all of those. And a bit more.</p>
<p>At first, I was quite disappointed 'cause the &quot;Powers&quot; at the title are
mentioned very early and then... nothing. There is a lot of going back and
forth (a few transitions are a bit weird, like suddenly the story being a
letter to the protagonist's wife) and you keep thinking &quot;Were the heck is this
going on?&quot; And then, suddenly, you keep reading a bit more because you want to
see a thread closed, and then read more, and more, and more... It's quite the
same feeling I got from <em>Changing Planes</em>, although the story here is way more
complex (not quite hard, as Changing Planes is a bunch of separate stories
instead of the continuous story of a slave who runs away, make friends, finds
his people, in a span of 10 or so years).</p>
<p>One of the things that Le Guin impresses me is how the way she describes
things approaches the way <em>Isaac Asimov</em> does: Describes the very minimum
necessary for the reader to understand why the characters are doing something,
and let their imagination soar with the rest. It's quite different from
<em>Arthur C Clarke</em>, which likes to over describe stuff.</p>
<p>In the end, it was a story that I was mostly uninterested at first but that
deeply moved me in the very end.</p>
