  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9272372-javascript-testing-beginner-s-guide">GoodReads Summary</a>:
This book is organized such that only the most essential information is
provided to you in each chapter so as to maximize your learning. Examples and
tutorials are given in an easy to follow, step-by-step manner so that you can
see how the testing process is being carried out and how the code is being
written. The source code also contains detailed explanation so that you know
what the code is doing. Multiple screenshots are used in places that matter so
that you have a visual sense of what is happening. Beginner JavaScript
developers looking for essential ways to write, test, and debug JavaScript for
different purposes and situations.</p>

	★☆☆☆☆

<p>Let me start this by saying that I really liked the structure of the book. For
each chapter, there is an explanation of what will be covered; a &quot;call for
action&quot; which shows the code and then describes, step by step, what is going
on; a further explanation on when running said code; and, finally, some
pointers on where to go forward.</p>
<p>That being said, this is a mess of a book. The kindle version is completely
mangled on the source code. Indentation is completely wrong, which makes the
code hard to read; the code is full of stupid mistakes (like having an object
and trying to get it again with <code>getElementById(element.id)</code>); and, generally,
it's pure bad code (like raising an exception inside a try/catch just to catch
it afterwards). Not only that, but the book goes incredible lengths to explain
JavaScript, what are unit tests and such and, just in the last chapter, it
finally explains JavaScript Testing.</p>
<p>That wouldn't be so bad if it was a recent book. But it's a book from 2010,
with no further editions, and a lot has changed in the JavaScript landscape in
those last 5 years. New frameworks appeared, new tools are here, JavaScript is
not client side only anymore... The list goes on and on. Heck, the author goes
lengths to explain how to test in IE because it's the most used browser at the
time!</p>
<p>Honestly, stay away from this book. Get a book about JavaScript. Get a book
about testing. Pick one of the JavaScript testing frameworks around (I know at
least 5), read its documentation and you'll be in a better place than reading
this.</p>
