The Earth's leaders have drawn a line in the interstellar sand—despite the
fact that the fierce alien enemy that they would oppose is inscrutable,
unconquerable, and very far away. A reluctant conscript drafted into an elite
Military unit, Private William Mandella has been propelled through space and
time to fight in the distant thousand-year conflict; to perform his duties
without rancor and even rise up through military ranks. Pvt. Mandella is
willing to do whatever it takes to survive the ordeal and return home. But
&quot;home&quot; may be even more terrifying than battle, because, thanks to the time
dilation caused by space travel, Mandella is aging months while the Earth he
left behind is aging centuries.</p>

<p>After I finished this book I had to ask myself why I never read anything else
by Haldeman.</p>
<p>In a way, this book seems to be the counterpart of Heinlen's &quot;Starship
Troopers&quot;: While Heinlein shows how smart the army can be, Haldeman seems to
show how the army can be pretty stupid sometimes.</p>
<p>It follows the story of William Mandella, who gets in the very first war
against an alien race that suddenly destroyed a colonizing ship. Due the way
humanity uses to travel the unverse, what happens in just a few days/weeks to
soldiers in-route, the everyone on Earth it takes years if not decades. So, in
the end, although Mandella gets into only 3 battles, his time on the
battlefield (well, on the way to the battlefield and back) goes around 900
years.</p>
<p>Also, there are some very clever things Haldeman did. At the very start, I
thought the story was a bit sexist. It turns out it was a very well thought
point Haldeman did to make a very long arc -- more like a criticism of the
sexism in the 70s than some hidden agenda towards sexism.</p>
<p>If I didn't had just read yet another book about wars, I'd probably keep going
through the series. But I guess I deserve a break after going through two
different wars.</p>
