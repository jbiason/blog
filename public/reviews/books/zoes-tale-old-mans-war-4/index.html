  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2102600.Zoe_s_Tale">GoodReads Summary</a>:
Everyone on Earth knows the tale I am part of. But you don't know my tale: How
I did what I did — how I did what I had to do — not just to stay alive but to
keep you alive, too. All of you. I'm going to tell it to you now, the only way
I know how: not straight but true, the whole thing, to try make you feel what
I felt: the joy and terror and uncertainty, panic and wonder, despair and
hope. Everything that happened, bringing us to Earth, and Earth out of its
captivity. All through my eyes.</p>

	★★★★☆

<p>It's been awhile since I've read <em>The Last Colony</em> and, when I started reading
this book, I thought &quot;I've already read this, but since I don't remember
everything, no damage in reading it again&quot;. And somethings were different, so
I thought &quot;Well, my memory is not the same anymore, it seems.&quot; And when I
finally finished the book and read the author's commentary about it, I finally
realized I didn't read &quot;Zoe's Tale&quot;. At all.</p>
<p>Instead of going forward with the tale of Old Man's War main protagonists,
Scalzi starts at the very start of &quot;Last Colony&quot; and tells the same story by
the eyes of another character, this time (wanna guess?) Zoe. Kinda like
[book:Shadow of the Giant|8647 (and its series), which follows Bean instead of
Ender.</p>
<p>It's a fun book -- I still love the way Scalzi writes -- but if you try to
read after reading Last Colony, you may think you're reading the same thing
again.</p>
