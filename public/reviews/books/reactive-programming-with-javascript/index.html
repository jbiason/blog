<p>If I had to define this book in a single word, I'd had to go with &quot;unfocused&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, with that title, you'd expect to learn about the principles that drove
the design of things like &quot;ReactJS&quot;. But it doesn't. This is not about
Reactive Programming. It's about ReactJS. And it's not about Reactive
Programming, it's about Reactive <em>Funcional</em> Programming.</p>
<p>Well, you'd still expect it to come with some conclusions about ReactJS,
right? Wrong again.</p>
<p>Most of the time you'll spend reading things that have absolutely no relation
with reactive programming, functional reactive programming or even ReactJS.
There is a long rant about C++ which ends with no conclusion at all and gives
no pointers on how it connects to the whole. There is another discussion about
INTERCAL which leads to nowhere -- maybe, except, the author's bank account
for the number of words.</p>
<p>At some point, the author finally discusses a bit of functional programming
talking about <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code> and <code>reduce</code>, but it goes nowhere from there and
a whole chapter with 10+ pages have a single paragraph about real, focused
talk about functional programming; the rest is just more rambling going to
nowhere.</p>
<p>If it was possible to run tests over the content of the book, the amount of
content out of a coverage on a BDD about Reactive Programming would point that
about 90% of it is never tested. It's content that talks absolutely <em>nothing</em>
about reactive programming, with large portions being repeated over and over
again (which makes me, once again, wonder why Packt pays for reviewers when
this kind of bullshit happens).</p>
<p>&quot;This book is about ReactJS&quot;, the author says in the introduction, but there
are only 4 chapters about ReactJS, with terrible JavaScript and absolutely no
explanation on <em>why</em> things are being designed that way.</p>
<p>You want a review in a single phrase? Ok, that phrase would be &quot;stay away from
this book&quot;.</p>
