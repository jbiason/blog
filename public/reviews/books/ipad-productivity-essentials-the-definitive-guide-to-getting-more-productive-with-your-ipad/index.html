You have your iPad, now what? You could continue to use your tablet as an
excellent web surfing tool. You could also use it to play one of the many,
many games out on the App Store. Or, you could simply turn it over to your
spouse or your kid(s) for their enjoyment. I suggest a different path, a path
that will keep your iPad in your hands, at work…a path that will put you on
the road towards increased productivity!</p>

<p><strong>Easy way to describe this: lazy</strong></p>
<p>You know, for a book with a subtitle of &quot;Get efficient with your iPad,
Evernote and GTD&quot; (or, at least, that's what my edition says in the cover), I
really expect something more around the lines of &quot;Here is GTD and here is how
you do this GTD thing with your iPad, and here is how you do this GTD thing
inside Evernote&quot;. Instead, the book goes talking about apps that two months
from now will not make sense, which are completely unrelated to each other (so
good look trying to mix them together and get something meaningful), and
which, most of the time, have nothing to do GTD or Evernote.</p>
<p>Also, there are a few quirks in the edition that really annoyed me: there some
marks around the text that seems there was some editor marking down
corrections to be made, but instead of checking those, the author decided to
publish the book with the marks instead of the final product.</p>
<p>In the end, it feels like a bunch of blog posts tied together instead of
something really targeted towards GTD and Evernote.</p>
