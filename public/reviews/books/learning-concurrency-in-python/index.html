  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36083578-learning-concurrency-in-python">GoodReads Summary</a>:
Practically and deeply understand concurrency in Python to write efficient
programs.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><div>
	★☆☆☆☆
</div>
<p>A good book if you want examples of code in some concurrency topics -- and some
that don't -- but nothing that could actually <em>teach</em> you how to use this.</p>
<p>For example, there are consecutive examples of things that only change one
option. It tells what the option says it does but doesn't example <em>what</em> it
actually does and <em>when</em> you should use it. The whole <em>when</em> is missing from the
book: Here is the options, here are examples for each option, have fun.</p>
<p>Also, as usual for Packt books, editing would require some work. For example,
you're following with examples using <code>.join()</code> but it is not initially explained
why you need to do that -- only a few sections later that you find out it &quot;waits
for the completion of threads/processes&quot;, with no mention that the call blocks
the current thread.</p>
<p>And, on top of that, none of the examples (ok, maybe two) actually follow
PEP8. It is a pet peeve of mine, I reckon, but when you're explaining some
language feature, I'd expect the examples to follow the code style of the
language (although it is not that bad 'cause at least there is a consistent
style through the book, even if it is not PEP8).</p>
<p>Suddenly, I have a feeling that the book is actually the notes of the author
while learning something, not something that they want to help you learn...</p>
