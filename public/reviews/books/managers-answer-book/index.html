Summary</a>:
Powerful Tools to Maximize Your Impact and Influence, Build Trust and Teams, and
Respond to Challenges</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><div>
	★★☆☆☆
</div>
<p>Honestly, I didn't finish reading the book.</p>
<p>First, the style of showing content by the way of questions doesn't quite fit
the way I read, specially when the questions are specially designed to provide
an answer -- and not the other way around.</p>
<p>Second, most of the answers are quite obvious, in the style &quot;How can I manage
X?&quot; with the answer &quot;Ask the people who were doing it in the first&quot;. Well, duh.</p>
<p>Third, the question style is somewhat confusing. It uses the pattern of &quot;I
read/saw/heard about X. What can I do about it?&quot;, with different styles of
X. There are even questions which one could almost say are non-sequiturs, like
(paraphrasing) &quot;I'm a highly hands-on person, how can I write the reports the
financial team is asking me?&quot;. You can be both, and none of those two are
actually related.</p>
<p>Fourth, there are a bunch of useless comments in the middle, which gives the
impression of filler, like &quot;As a manager, you have to do several things.&quot; No
shit, Sherlock.</p>
<p>And fifth, by 75% of the book, there was a question about what one should report
and I quote &quot;Evidence of union activity should be reported to your human
resources or legal support as soon as possible. Early detection of and rapid
response to union activity has long been key to union avoidance.&quot; So, if I get
this right, it means that me, as a manager, should be a union busting asshole?
Fuck. Off.</p>
<p>That's when I gave up. I was already tired of the style and then, instead of
suggesting speaking to people invested in it to check why they believe an union
is necessary or what could be done to avoid the creation of the union in the
first place. But no, you must report to legal so they can burst the whole thing
down. Great, what a great person you've become.</p>
