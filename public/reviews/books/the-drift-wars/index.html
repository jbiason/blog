Peter Garvey was just a kid when the warships emerged from the Drift and
devastated his homeworld. He enlisted immediately, leaving behind his
small-town life to fight in distant space.</p>
<p>Barely surviving basic training, he is thrust to the front line to battle the
Riel, an army of creatures beyond his darkest nightmares.</p>

	★★★☆☆

<p>There are very few books that I've read that made my head spin by being so
terrible describing action scenes. There is <em>Neuromancer</em> has pretty damn good
action sequences. This one, no.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because you can't really get the pace of the sequence. Maybe it's
because it's badly described. Maybe it's because things sound so cartoonish
you can't really go. I mean, how can I imagine an action sequence when the big
bad guy seems to be a Spidermon from Doom on steroids, the middle guys felt
like Carnage from Spiderman and the mind-guys seemed copies of Mordin from
Mass Effect.</p>
<p>And let's not forget the main plot machine, which makes absolutely no sense at
all -- even if it's a pretty damn concept to keep the story flowing.</p>
<p>Speaking of flowing, if you take the heavy packed sequences and the enemies
description, it's a pretty damn good book. Almost like &quot;All You Need Is Kill&quot;
in structure and plot advancement.</p>
<p>So it's not a bad book at all, and may feel like a really good read if you
managed to follow Neuromancer sequences.</p>
