Michael Gallatin is a British spy with a peculiar talent: the ability to
transform himself into a wolf. Although his work in North Africa helped the
Allies win the continent in the early days of World War II, he quit the service
when a German spy shot his lover in her bed. Now, three years later, the army
asks him to end his retirement and parachute into occupied Paris. A mysterious
German plan called the Iron Fist threatens the D-Day invasion, and the Nazi in
charge is the spy who betrayed Michael’s lover. The werewolf goes to France for
king and country, hoping for a chance at bloody vengeance.</p>

	★★★☆☆

<p>This is truly a weird book.</p>
<p>So you take the idea of mythical creatures like werewolfs. And you take great
events in history, like World War II. And then you mix both.</p>
<p>In one hand, the book is almost silly in its premise. And, as if it was a 60s
spy movie, it makes the hero always get the girl -- which is narrated almost as
a horny teenage vision of what sex could be.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is a bunch of what seems real information: Locations,
dates, aircrafts, guns you name it. It's almost as the author really did some
research on geography and history about WWII events.</p>
<p>This dichotomy permeates the book in every place. The very beginning of the
book reminded of a site that gathered the most absurd adverbs: &quot;like a ghost in
the night&quot; and the like. So, at the very start, it feels like it is a bad book,
but then you get what seems like real events happening (with a touch of what
was done in Assassin's Creed series of games) and then it seems like a real
book. And then you get the horny parts and it goes back to silly.</p>
