IN THE YEAR 2044, reality is an ugly place. The only time teenage Wade Watts
really feels alive is when he's jacked into the virtual utopia known as the
OASIS. Wade's devoted his life to studying the puzzles hidden within this
world's digital confines, puzzles that are based on their creator's obsession
with the pop culture of decades past and that promise massive power and
fortune to whoever can unlock them.</p>

<p><strong>80s, Back to Back</strong></p>
<p>First, small spoiler: imagine a world were Second Life won and reached its
wildest dream. A world created by an 80s aficionado. Imagine there is a prize
hidden somewhere. Imagine the locks are all based on 80s stuff. That's the
book. </p>
<p>Now, if you're a children of the 80s, this will be a great ride. You'll find a
bunch of stuff you remember appearing everywhere. And you'll remember what it
was and it will be fun. </p>
<p>All this you can read in all other reviews. </p>
<p>The story suddenly drops mid book before returning to the old 80s memorabilia
trip. A couple of pages could remove one hundred and the book would be a lot
more fun (and that's why I'm not giving it 5 starts). </p>
<p>Some things will piss you off: the &quot;evil&quot; guys are one dimensional. The
romance is dull. The hero never gets in a corner he doesn't find a way out.
The fights are too colorful. It may not sound so, but it is annoying.... Till
you realize 80s movies were just like that. </p>
<p>It's really a fun book and I never knew I could read that fast. </p>
