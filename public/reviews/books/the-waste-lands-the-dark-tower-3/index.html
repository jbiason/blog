Several months have passed, and Roland’s two new tet-mates have become
proficient gunslingers. Eddie Dean has given up heroin, and Odetta’s two
selves have joined, becoming the stronger and more balanced personality of
Susannah Dean. But while battling The Pusher in 1977 New York, Roland altered
ka by saving the life of Jake Chambers, a boy who—in Roland’s where and
when—has already died. Now Roland and Jake exist in different worlds, but they
are joined by the same madness: the paradox of double memories. Roland,
Susannah, and Eddie must draw Jake into Mid-World then follow the Path of the
Beam all the way to the Dark Tower. But nothing is easy in Mid-World. Along
the way our tet stumbles into the ruined city of Lud, and are caught between
the warring gangs of the Pubes and the Grays. The only way out of Lud is to
wake Blaine the Mono, an insane train that has a passion for riddling, and for
suicidal journeys.</p>

	★★★★☆
</div>
<p>The very first book was mostly a backstory to the series.</p>
<p>The second book was the first &quot;in the story&quot; of the series.</p>
<p>This, the third, is mostly King going &quot;Well, now I'm writer, I can write
whatever I can&quot;. And so he does.</p>
<p>The story flows nicely and a lot of things that you could feel King was
holding back in the second story are not here. Whatever he things he can do,
he does. So the story goes into larger arcs, deeper content and so on.</p>
<p>The only downside is the ending. About 10% of book you feel like that &quot;Oh
shit, he's not going to defuse the bomb&quot; or whatever happened in the old TV
series and you can feel the &quot;To be continued.&quot; coming.</p>
<p>And &quot;To be continued&quot; comes.</p>
