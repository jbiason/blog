  <p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8289480/">IMDB Summary</a>:
The Treadstone project, having created super spy Jason Bourne, turns its
attention on a new protocol to develop unstoppable superhuman assassins.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><div>
	★☆☆☆☆

<p>I have no idea who the hell watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258463/">The Bourne
Identity</a> and thought the cool part
wasn't Bourne/Matt Damon lightning reflexes or his uncanny ability to find an
escape, but actually the bureaucracy that created him. Probably Barney
Stinson<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a way, the series was doomed by its own format: While in a movie the actors
can film the &quot;easy&quot; scenes first while they train to do the most action heavy
scenes, in a series they don't have that luxury: This is the episode, and this
is what it will happen. There is no time for practicing some martial art or
take time training the movements in a scene over and over; there is very little
time between episodes and even littler time for this kind of stuff.</p>
<p>That's not to say that there isn't any action; there is. But is far away from
Damon's character kicking ass with a magazine.</p>
<p>So, the only remaining thing is the bureau and its problem. And that is a
complete drag, not even making it interesting in a mystery kind of way.
Unexpected things are happening, but the bureau moves in the pace of, well,
bureaucracy.</p>
<p>There is a cliffhanger in the end of the only season, and it is not even good.</p>

<p>For those who haven't seen &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_I_Met_Your_Mother">How I Met Your
Mother</a>&quot;, there was a
running gag in which the character played by Neil Patrick Harris named
&quot;Barney&quot; would say that the real &quot;Karate Kid&quot; was the blonde kid played by
William Zabka, and that the character played by Ralph Macchio was, actually,
the bad guy.</p>
