  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WandaVision">Wikipedia Summary</a>: WandaVision is
an American television miniseries created by Jac Schaeffer for the streaming
service Disney+, based on Marvel Comics featuring the characters Wanda Maximoff
/ Scarlet Witch and Vision.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>This is (I believe) the first forray of Disney into the Marvel after buying it
-- or, at least, the first outside the movies which Marvel had planned all
along.</p>
<p>In a way, it is a fun series, mostly 'cause you may have seen a TV series that
Wandavision is replicating. But not everything is copycating some series, there
is a story going on the side, which tries to explain why you're watching Wanda
and Vision in, say, &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; style, although the real reason is actually
shown in the very last episodes.</p>
<p>And the real reason for the multiple series is actually a pretty good reason,
but someone decided that it was time to introduce another villain, just in case
Disney decided to make a Wanda movie in the future.</p>
<p>In case you didn't spoil yourself yet, here it goes: Wanda is using her full
power to create an illusion in the same style of the series she watched as a
kid, after losing Vision and her brother in the movies. So the whole thing is
actually a way to deal with loss and how people search escape from the sad
feelings they feel and that affects people around -- which is a pretty large
affect part when you have magical powers.</p>
<p>Acting is top notch, with Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany still doing the
quality they did in the movies. The rest of the cast just follows along.</p>
<p>In the end, it is fun series, even when the message is pretty dark.</p>
